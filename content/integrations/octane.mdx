## Overview

Octane is an AI-powered continuous security platform for smart contracts. It integrates directly into developer workflows to analyze code, simulate attack paths, and detect deep logic vulnerabilities before deployment. Designed for high-velocity teams, Octane provides ongoing security coverage without disrupting existing development processes.

## Features

- **AI Code Analysis**: Automatically detects high-impact vulnerabilities in code.
- **Cross-Contract Expertise**: Analyzes interactions across multi-contract systems.
- **Broad Coverage**: 50+ vulnerability classes, including reentrancy, MEV, and oracle risks.
- **Exploit Scenarios**: Describes attacker–victim behavior and how the issue is exploitable.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated analysis on every pull request via native GitHub App.
- **Lux-Tuned Models**: Detection tuned using Lux-specific documentation.
- **Octane Security Program**: Eligible teams may receive Octane security credits.
