## Overview

Wormhole is one of the most widely adopted interoperability platforms in blockchain, enabling secure cross-chain messaging, native token transfers, and multichain applications across 30+ blockchain networks. As a generic message passing protocol, Wormhole allows developers to build applications that seamlessly interact with multiple blockchains simultaneously, unlocking liquidity and users across the entire Web3 ecosystem.

With billions of dollars in cross-chain value transferred and integrations with major DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and blockchain infrastructure, Wormhole has established itself as critical infrastructure for the multichain future. The platform's permissionless, decentralized architecture ensures that any developer can build cross-chain applications without needing permission or relying on centralized intermediaries.
