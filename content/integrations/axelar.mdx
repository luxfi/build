## Overview

Axelar is a proof-of-stake blockchain and decentralized interoperability network that connects 80+ blockchain ecosystems, enabling secure cross-chain communication, token transfers, and smart contract calls through a single, simple programmable interface. As a full-stack solution combining a decentralized network, protocols, APIs, and developer tools, Axelar enables developers to build truly multichain applications with the same ease as building on a single chain.

Secured by a dynamic validator set and leveraging the Cosmos SDK and Tendermint consensus, Axelar provides security and decentralization that rivals native blockchains while enabling seamless interoperability. With over $2 billion in cross-chain volume and integrations powering major DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and decentralized applications, Axelar has established itself as critical infrastructure for Web3's multichain future.
