## Logo Guidelines

- **Size**: 200x200px recommended (will be displayed at 40x40px)
- **Background**: Transparent or solid color

### File Naming
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `your-integration.png`
- Match your MDX filename: `example-protocol.mdx` → `example-protocol.png`

### Location
Place your logo in `/public/images/` directory.

## Code Examples (When Applicable)

If your integration requires code, follow these guidelines:

### Use Lux-Specific Values

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Shows Lux configuration
const provider = new Provider({
  chainId: 43114, // Lux LUExchange-Chain
  rpcUrl: "https://api.lux.network/ext/bc/C/rpc"
});
```

```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Generic example
const provider = new Provider({
  chainId: 1, // Ethereum
});
```

### Keep It Simple

```typescript
// ✅ Good - Clear and focused
import { YourSDK } from 'your-sdk';

const client = new YourSDK({
  apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,
  network: 'lux'
});

const result = await client.query({ /* ... */ });
```

```typescript
// ❌ Bad - Too complex for getting started
// Multiple files, complex error handling, etc.
```
