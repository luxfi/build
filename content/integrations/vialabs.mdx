## Overview

VIA Labs provides Lux L1s with Proto-USD, a solution that enables seamless USDC integration across multiple blockchain networks. By combining Lux's native Interchain Messaging (ICM) infrastructure with Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), VIA Labs allows any Lux L1 to receive and utilize USDC from networks like Ethereum, Base, Solana, and other CCTP-enabled chains.

## Features

- **Native ICM Integration**: Utilizes Lux's built-in cross-chain messaging infrastructure.
- **USDC Cross-Chain Support**: Enables transfer of USDC between Lux L1s and other major blockchains.
- **Bridged USDC Standard**: Implements standardized approach for USDC representation across chains.
- **CCTP Compatibility**: Leverages Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol for secure token transfers.
- **Testnet-Ready**: Available on testnet for all Lux L1s.
- **Path to Native Issuance**: Sets Lux L1s on an onboarding path to potential native USDC issuance.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Compatible with Ethereum, Base, Solana (coming soon), and other CCTP-enabled chains.
