## Overview

Magic provides trusted wallet infrastructure with over 7 years of proven reliability and performance. The platform enables developers to provision wallets on demand for users, agents, and everything in between via a powerful API. With enterprise-grade security including SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001:2022, HIPAA, CCPA, and GDPR compliance, Magic offers sub-second latency (50-100ms) for wallet creation and transaction signing, flexible authentication options, whitelabel UI customization, and non-custodial architecture where users maintain full control of their digital assets. The infrastructure is massively scalable, capable of executing millions of signatures in minutes, and features multi-layered resilience with keys distributed and encrypted across isolated services using trusted execution environments (TEEs).
