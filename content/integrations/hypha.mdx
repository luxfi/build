## Overview

Hypha (formerly GoGoPool) is a decentralized validator marketplace and liquid staking protocol built on Lux. The platform enables builders to achieve fully permissionless Layer 1 blockchains, allowing creators to innovate without fear of centralized control. Hypha provides the infrastructure and tools necessary for validators, stakers, and Layer 1 builders to participate in the Lux ecosystem with minimal barriers to entry.

## Features

- **Minipools & Liquid Staking**: Validate Lux with reduced requirements and earn yields through ggLUX liquid staking token.
- **Layer 1 Launcher**: Deploy your own Layer 1 blockchain with ease and attract validators through custom marketplaces.
- **Layer 1 Marketplace**: Discover and engage with decentralized Layer 1s, participate in validation, staking, or delegation.
- **ggLUX Token**: Liquid staking token that allows users to earn yield while maintaining liquidity.
- **Permissionless Validation**: Democratizes validator participation by lowering the technical and capital barriers.
- **Validator Infrastructure**: Decentralized network of validators ensuring security and reliability.
- **DeFi Integrations**: ggLUX is integrated with major DeFi protocols including DeltaPrime, Balancer, Wombat Exchange, and Uniswap.
