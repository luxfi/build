## Overview

x402-rs is a Rust-based implementation of the x402 protocol that enables blockchain payments directly through HTTP using the native `402 Payment Required` status code on Lux's LUExchange-Chain.

The x402 protocol allows servers to declare payment requirements for specific routes. Clients send cryptographically signed payment payloads, and facilitators verify and settle payments on-chain.

## What x402-rs Provides

- **x402-rs core**: Protocol types, facilitator traits, and logic for on-chain payment verification and settlement
- **Facilitator binary**: Production-grade HTTP server to verify and settle x402 payments
- **x402-axum**: Axum middleware for accepting x402 payments
- **x402-reqwest**: Wrapper for reqwest for transparent x402 payments

## Getting Started

### Run the Facilitator

The quickest way to get started is using Docker:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 ukstv/x402-facilitator
```

Or build locally:

```bash
docker build -t x402-rs .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 x402-rs
```

### Protect Axum Routes

Use `x402-axum` to gate your routes behind on-chain payments on Lux:

```rust
let x402 = X402Middleware::try_from("https://x402.org/facilitator/").unwrap();
let usdc = USDCDeployment::by_network(Network::LuxTestnet);

let app = Router::new().route("/paid-content", get(handler).layer( 
        x402.with_price_tag(usdc.amount("0.025").pay_to("0xYourAddress").unwrap())
    ),
);
```

See the [x402-axum crate documentation](https://docs.rs/x402-axum) for more details.

### Send x402 Payments

Use `x402-reqwest` to send payments on Lux:

```rust
use x402_reqwest::X402ClientExt;

let signer: PrivateKeySigner = "0x...".parse()?; // never hardcode real keys!

let client = reqwest::Client::new()
    .with_payments(signer)
    .prefer(USDCDeployment::by_network(Network::Lux))
    .max(USDCDeployment::by_network(Network::Lux).amount("1.00")?)
    .build();

let res = client
    .get("https://example.com/protected")
    .send()
    .await?;
```

See the [x402-reqwest crate documentation](https://docs.rs/x402-reqwest) for more details.

## Facilitator

The x402-rs facilitator is a runnable binary that simplifies x402 adoption by handling:

- **Payment verification**: Confirming that client-submitted payment payloads match the declared requirements
- **Payment settlement**: Submitting validated payments to the blockchain and monitoring their confirmation

By using a facilitator, servers (sellers) do not need to:
- Connect directly to a blockchain
- Implement complex cryptographic or blockchain-specific payment logic

The facilitator never holds user funds. It acts solely as a stateless verification and execution layer for signed payment payloads.

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file or set environment variables directly:

```bash
HOST=0.0.0.0
PORT=8080
RPC_URL_LUX_FUJI=https://api.lux-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
RPC_URL_LUX=https://api.lux.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
SIGNER_TYPE=private-key
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef
RUST_LOG=info
```

**Important:** The supported networks are determined by which RPC URLs you provide:

- If you set only `RPC_URL_LUX_FUJI`, then only Lux Testnet testnet is supported
- If you set both `RPC_URL_LUX_FUJI` and `RPC_URL_LUX`, then both testnet and mainnet are supported
- If an RPC URL for a network is missing, that network will not be available for settlement or verification

### Environment Variables

Available configuration variables:

- `RUST_LOG`: Logging level (e.g., `info`, `debug`, `trace`)
- `HOST`: HTTP host to bind to (default: `0.0.0.0`)
- `PORT`: HTTP server port (default: `8080`)
- `SIGNER_TYPE` (required): Type of signer to use. Only `private-key` is supported now
- `EVM_PRIVATE_KEY` (required): Private key in hex for EVM networks
- `RPC_URL_LUX_FUJI`: Ethereum RPC endpoint for Lux Testnet testnet
- `RPC_URL_LUX`: Ethereum RPC endpoint for Lux LUExchange-Chain mainnet

### Docker Deployment

Prebuilt Docker images are available at:

- **GitHub Container Registry**: `ghcr.io/x402-rs/x402-facilitator`
- **Docker Hub**: `ukstv/x402-facilitator`

Run the container from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 ukstv/x402-facilitator
```

To run using GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/x402-rs/x402-facilitator
```

Or build a Docker image locally:

```bash
docker build -t x402-rs .
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:8080 x402-rs
```

The container:
- Exposes port `8080` (or a port you configure with `PORT` environment variable)
- Starts on `http://localhost:8080` by default
- Requires minimal runtime dependencies (based on `debian:bullseye-slim`)

### Point Your Application to Your Facilitator

If you are building an x402-powered application, update the Facilitator URL to point to your self-hosted instance.

**Using x402-hono:**

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { serve } from "@hono/node-server";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-hono";

const app = new Hono();

// Configure the payment middleware
app.use(paymentMiddleware(
  "0xYourAddress", // Your receiving wallet address
  {
    "/protected-route": {
      price: "$0.10",
      network: "lux-testnet",
      config: {
        description: "Access to premium content",
      }
    }
  },
  {
    url: "http://your-validator.url/", // 👈 Your self-hosted Facilitator
  }
));

// Implement your protected route
app.get("/protected-route", (c) => {
  return c.json({ message: "This content is behind a paywall" });
});

serve({
  fetch: app.fetch,
  port: 3000
});
```

**Using x402-axum:**

```rust
let x402 = X402Middleware::try_from("http://your-validator.url/").unwrap();  // 👈 Your self-hosted Facilitator
let usdc = USDCDeployment::by_network(Network::LuxTestnet);

let app = Router::new().route("/paid-content", get(handler).layer( 
        x402.with_price_tag(usdc.amount("0.025").pay_to("0xYourAddress").unwrap())
    ),
);
```

## Observability

The facilitator emits OpenTelemetry-compatible traces and metrics, making it easy to integrate with tools like Honeycomb, Prometheus, Grafana, and others. Tracing spans are annotated with HTTP method, status code, URI, latency, and other request and process metadata.

To enable tracing and metrics export, set the appropriate `OTEL_` environment variables:

```bash
# For Honeycomb, for example:
# Endpoint URL for sending OpenTelemetry traces and metrics
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://api.honeycomb.io:443
# Comma-separated list of key=value pairs to add as headers
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=x-honeycomb-team=your_api_key,x-honeycomb-dataset=x402-rs
# Export protocol to use for telemetry. Supported values: `http/protobuf` (default), `grpc`
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
```

The service automatically detects and initializes exporters if `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_*` variables are provided.

## Lux LUExchange-Chain Support

The facilitator supports Lux LUExchange-Chain through these environment variables:

| Network                   | Environment Variable      | Notes                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Lux Testnet Testnet    | RPC_URL_LUX_FUJI   | Recommended for testing          |
| Lux LUExchange-Chain Mainnet | RPC_URL_LUX        | Production mainnet               |

**Tip:** For initial development and testing, start with Lux Testnet testnet only.
