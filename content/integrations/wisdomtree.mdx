## Overview

WisdomTree is a pioneering financial services company with over $100 billion in assets under management, known for innovation in exchange-traded products and now leading the integration of blockchain technology into traditional finance. WisdomTree operates across three major platforms: traditional ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products), WisdomTree Prime (a blockchain-native consumer app), and WisdomTree Connect (an institutional tokenization and infrastructure platform).

Through these platforms, WisdomTree provides access to tokenized real-world assets, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and traditional securities, all while maintaining the regulatory compliance and institutional trust built over two decades in traditional finance. WisdomTree's vision is to democratize access to diverse asset classes through blockchain technology, making sophisticated investment strategies available to both retail and institutional investors.
