## Overview

Circle is a global financial technology company that provides payment infrastructure for the digital economy.

USDC is natively available on Lux LUExchange-Chain, enabling fast, low-cost transactions for payments, DeFi, and enterprise applications.

Beyond stablecoins, Circle offers a comprehensive suite of developer services including Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), smart contract wallets, payment gateways, and gasless transaction infrastructure that enable developers to build seamless on-chain experiences on Lux.
