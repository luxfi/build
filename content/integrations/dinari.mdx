## Overview

Dinari is building the infrastructure to provide non-U.S. retail investors with tokenized access to U.S. public equities through blockchain technology. Operating through a B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) model, Dinari partners with neobanks, fintech applications, and embedded finance platforms that want to offer their customers regulated exposure to U.S. stocks using blockchain-based infrastructure.

By tokenizing shares of U.S. public companies, Dinari enables international investors to gain access to American stock markets through their local platforms without the complexity and cost barriers of traditional cross-border brokerage. Each token represents economic exposure to actual shares held in custody, providing users with the investment performance of U.S. equities combined with the efficiency, programmability, and 24/7 availability of blockchain technology.
