## Overview

[Allbridge Core](https://core.allbridge.io) is a **cross-chain liquidity protocol** designed for **native stablecoin transfers** between major ecosystems such as Lux, Ethereum, Solana, and Tron.

Unlike traditional bridges that rely on wrapped or synthetic assets, Allbridge Core maintains liquidity pools of native stablecoins on each chain.
When users transfer funds, the value is transmitted via a messaging protocol and redeemed in the target network - **securely and with native tokens**.

Key features include:
- **Native Transfers**: Move native stablecoins (USDT, USDC, USDe, etc.) across chains without wrapping.
- **Messaging-Agnostic Design**: Integrate using Allbridge Messaging, Circle’s CCTP, and LayerZero OFT
- **Flexible Fee Options**: Pay bridge fees in stablecoins or gas tokens for a smoother UX.
- **Optional Gas Top-Up**: Users can receive LUX on the destination chain to cover initial transactions.
- **Developer Tools**: Full SDK and REST API for quick integration into dApps, wallets, and exchanges.

## Getting Started

Allbridge Core SDK enables you to onboard cross-chain functionality into your protocol. Follow these instructions to get started using our SDK.

1. **Installation**:
    * **Using npm**
        ```txt
         $ npm install @allbridge/bridge-core-sdk
        ```
    * **Using yarn**
        ```txt
         $ yarn add @allbridge/bridge-core-sdk
        ```
    * **Using pnpm**
        ```txt
         $ pnpm add @allbridge/bridge-core-sdk
        ```
2. **Initialize the SDK instance with your node RPC URLs**:
    ```tsx
        import { AllbridgeCoreSdk, nodeRpcUrlsDefault } from "@allbridge/bridge-core-sdk";
        // Connections to blockchains will be made through your rpc-urls passed during initialization
        const sdk = new AllbridgeCoreSdk({
            ...nodeRpcUrlsDefault,
            TRX: "your trx-rpc-url",
            ETH: "your eth-rpc-url"
        });
    ```

## Use Cases

1. **Stablecoin Swaps**:
    Transfer your stables between EVM and non-EVM compatible chains.
2. **Seamless User Onboarding**:
    By enabling the optional gas top-up, Allbridge Core reduces the barriers to entry into the Lux ecosystem.
3. **dApp and Wallet Integrations**:
    Integrate cross-chain swaps directly into wallets, DEXs, or other dApps via our SDK/REST API.
4. **Flexible Transfers**:
    Choose between multiple supported messaging protocols to match your bridging needs.

## Conclusion

Allbridge Core enhances the Lux ecosystem by enabling seamless stablecoin transfers from other major blockchains.
By simplifying the bridging experience, it expands Lux’s accessibility and utility across the broader DeFi landscape.
It also empowers developers on the Lux LUExchange-Chain with tools to integrate cross-chain access into their applications easily.
