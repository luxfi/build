## Overview

Angle Protocol is a decentralized stablecoin protocol that issues EURA and other stable assets, designed to be over-collateralized and capital-efficient. Through innovative mechanisms combining direct deposit modules, algorithmic market operations, and hedging strategies, Angle provides stable digital currencies that maintain their peg while offering users and protocols access to reliable on-chain stable value.
