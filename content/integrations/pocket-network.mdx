## Overview

Pocket Network is a decentralized infrastructure protocol that provides reliable, censorship-resistant RPC (Remote Procedure Call) services for blockchain networks. By utilizing a distributed network of node operators, Pocket Network ensures high availability, redundancy, and geographic diversity for accessing blockchain data, making it an ideal solution for developers building decentralized applications.

## Features

- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Distributed network of thousands of independent node operators ensures no single point of failure.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Access to multiple blockchain networks including Ethereum, Lux, and many others.
- **High Availability**: Redundant node infrastructure provides reliable uptime and performance.
- **Censorship-Resistant**: Decentralized architecture prevents any single entity from controlling or censoring access.
- **Cost-Effective**: Competitive pricing through a decentralized marketplace of node operators.
- **Load Balancing**: Automatic routing to the best available nodes for optimal performance.
- **Native Token Economics**: POKT token incentivizes node operators to provide quality service.

## Documentation
