## Overview
[Chronicle Protocol](https://chroniclelabs.org/) is a novel Oracle solution that overcomes the current limitations of transferring data onchain by developing scalable, cost-efficient, decentralized, and verifiable Oracles.
For the data feeds addresses, please check out the [Chronicle Dashboard](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard) under **Oracles** section. Select either **Mainnets** or **Testnets**, then **Lux LUExchange-Chain Oracles**.

### Data Feeds Types
Chronicle provides two categories of Oracles: [DeFi Oracles](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/Products/DeFiOracle/) and [Verified Asset Oracles (VAO)](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/Products/DeFiOracle/).

DeFi Oracles include:
- Cryptocurrency Oracles
- Fiat Currency Oracles
- Yield Rate Oracles

[The Verified Asset Oracle (VAO)](https://docs.chroniclelabs.org/Products/VerifiedAssetOracle/) — formerly known as the RWA Oracle — securely and transparently verifies the integrity and quality of any offchain asset, transports the resulting data onchain, and makes it directly available to smart contracts and onchain products.

### Check the Chronicle Oracles on the Chronicle Dashboard

- [Lux Testnet Testnet Oracles](https://chroniclelabs.org/dashboard/oracles#testnet=true&blockchain=FUJI)

## Using Chronicle DeFi Oracles on Lux Testnet Testnet

The following example showcases how to integrate the LUX/USD oracle on Lux Testnet Testnet.

Chronicle contracts are read-protected by a whitelist, meaning you won't be able to read them onchain without your address being added to the whitelist. 
On the Testnet networks, users can add themselves to the whitelist through the SelfKisser contract; a process playfully referred to as "kissing" themselves. 
**To get access to production Oracles on the Mainnet, please open a support ticket in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/CjgvJ9EspJ) in the 🆘 ｜ support channel.**
