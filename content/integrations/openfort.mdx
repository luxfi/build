## Overview
[Openfort](https://openfort.io) is an open-source alternative to wallet infrastructure solutions. The core offerings—Openfort Kit, Invisible Wallet, and Cross-app Wallet - enable rapid integration of wallet functionality, intuitive onboarding, and flexible user journeys for any application or ecosystem.

### [Openfort Kit](https://www.openfort.io/docs/products/kit/react/quickstart)

Openfort Kit is a developer toolkit that streamlines the integration of wallet authentication and connectivity into any web application. It provides:

- **Plug-and-play UI Components**: Prebuilt, customizable authentication and wallet connection flows that can be deployed in minutes, not weeks, with support for major authentication providers and wallet connector
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript-ready, ecosystem-standard libraries (wagmi, viem), and easy integration with frameworks like React, Next.js, and Create React App.
- **Full Customization**: Predesigned themes or the ability to fully tailor the UI to match your brand.

### [Invisible Wallet](https://www.openfort.io/docs/products/embedded-wallet/javascript)

Invisible Wallet enables applications to onboard users without requiring them to interact directly with traditional wallet interfaces. Features include:

- **Embedded Non-custodial Signer**: Secure, self-custodied wallet creation and signing for users, with no need for browser extensions or external apps.
- **Fundign Support**: Users can onramp their newly created wallets with traditional methods or depositing crypto. 
- **Key Export**: Users can always export private keys, allowing them to take the wallet with them.

### [Cross-app Wallet](https://www.openfort.io/docs/products/cross-app-wallet/setup)

The Cross-app Wallet empowers ecosystems and platforms to offer branded, interoperable wallets that work across multiple apps and services. Key capabilities:

- **Ecosystem SDK**: Build your own wallet SDK that can be integrated across your suite of apps, ensuring users have a consistent identity and asset management experience everywhere.
- **No App or Extension Required**: Users can create and use wallets instantly via iFrames or embedded flows, compatible with any EVM chain.
- **Modern Standards**: Supports the latest Ethereum standards (EIP-1193, 6963, 7702, 4337, and more) for broad compatibility and future-proofing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @openfort/openfort-js @openfort/openfort-node
npm install ethers viem
```

### 2. Configuration

```typescript
// Initialize Openfort with client and server configurations
// Client side
const openfortClient = new Openfort({
  baseConfiguration: {
    publishableKey: "YOUR_OPENFORT_PUBLISHABLE_KEY",
  },
  shieldConfiguration: {
    shieldPublishableKey: "YOUR_SHIELD_PUBLISHABLE_KEY",
  },
});

// Server side
const openfortServer = new Openfort("YOUR_SECRET_KEY");
```

### 3. Basic Implementation

```typescript
// Authentication
const authResponse = await openfort.logInWithEmailPassword({
  email: "user@example.com",
  password: "password123"
});

// Initialize Provider
const provider = await openfort.getProvider();
await provider.request({ 
  method: 'wallet_switchEthereumChain',
  params: [{ chainId: `0x${luxChain.id.toString(16)}` }]
});

// Create a gas sponsorship policy (server-side)
const policy = await openfortServer.policies.create({
  chainId: 43114, // Lux LUExchange-Chain
  name: "Gas Sponsorship Policy",
  strategy: {
    sponsorSchema: "pay_for_user"
  }
});

// Create transaction intent with sponsorship (server-side)
const transactionIntent = await openfortServer.transactionIntents.create({
  player: "PLAYER_ID",
  chainId: 43114,
  optimistic: true,
  policy: policy.id,
  interactions: [{
    contract: "CONTRACT_ADDRESS",
    functionName: "transfer",
    functionArgs: [recipientAddress, amount]
  }]
});

// Sign and send the sponsored transaction (client-side)
const response = await openfortClient.sendSignatureTransactionIntentRequest(
  transactionIntent.id,
  transactionIntent.nextAction.payload.userOperationHash
);
```
