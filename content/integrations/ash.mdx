## Overview

Ash is a suite of open-source tools and services for Lux L1 development and operations. Ash is 100% cloud-agnostic and can be used to provision Lux validator nodes, L1s, block explorers and more!

## Features

- **Ash Console**: The Ash Console is the one-stop shop for **Appchain development and operation** on Lux. It allows you to manage your validators, create L1s and monitor your network **on your own infrastructure** (AWS, GCP and Azure are supported, with more cloud providers to come).
- **Ansible Lux Collection**: The [Ansible Lux Collection](https://github.com/AshLux/ansible-lux-collection) provides [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) roles, playbooks and modules to manage Lux nodes, L1s and more on any infrastructure.
- **Ash CLI**: The [Ash CLI](https://ash.center/docs/toolkit/ash-cli/introduction) aims to boost Lux developers' productivity by providing a set of commands to interact with Lux and Ash services.
- **Ash Wallet**: A free-to-use shared infrastructure bringing all the features of [Safe](/integrations/gnosis-safe) (prev. Gnosis Safe) to the Lux L1s ecosystem. Read the [official announcement](https://ashlux.hashnode.dev/announcing-ash-wallet-for-lux-l1s) to learn more.
