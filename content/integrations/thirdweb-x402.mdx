## Overview

Thirdweb's x402 facilitator is a service that handles verifying and submitting x402 payments on Lux's LUExchange-Chain. It uses your own server wallet and leverages EIP-7702 to submit transactions gaslessly, making it easy to integrate payment-gated APIs and AI services.

The thirdweb facilitator is compatible with any x402 backend and middleware libraries like `x402-hono`, `x402-next`, `x402-express`, and more.

## How It Works

- **Verification**: Validates payment signatures and requirements
- **Settlement**: Submits the payment transaction on-chain
- **Gasless**: Uses EIP-7702 for gasless transactions
- **Your Wallet**: Uses your own server wallet for receiving payments

You can view all transactions processed by your facilitator in your thirdweb project dashboard.

## Chain and Token Support

The thirdweb facilitator supports payments on **any EVM chain**, including Lux LUExchange-Chain, as long as the payment token supports either:

- **ERC-2612 permit** (most ERC20 tokens)
- **ERC-3009 sign with authorization** (USDC on all chains)

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Support**: Works on Lux LUExchange-Chain and all EVM-compatible chains
- **Gasless Transactions**: Leverages EIP-7702 for user-friendly payment experience
- **Your Own Wallet**: Use your own server wallet to receive payments directly
- **Dashboard Monitoring**: Track all facilitator transactions in your thirdweb dashboard
- **Compatible Middleware**: Works with all x402 middleware libraries

## Getting Started

### Creating a Facilitator

Create a facilitator instance to use with x402 payments:

```typescript
import { facilitator } from "thirdweb/x402";
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  secretKey: "your-secret-key",
});

const thirdwebFacilitator = facilitator({
  client: client,
  serverWalletAddress: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
});
```

### Configuration Options

```typescript
const thirdwebFacilitator = facilitator({
  // Required: Your thirdweb client with secret key
  client: client,
  
  // Required: Your server wallet address that will execute transactions
  // get it from your project dashboard
  serverWalletAddress: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
  
  // Optional: Wait behavior for settlements
  // - "simulated": Only simulate the transaction (fastest)
  // - "submitted": Wait until transaction is submitted
  // - "confirmed": Wait for full on-chain confirmation (slowest, default)
  waitUntil: "confirmed",
});
```

## Integration Examples

### Usage with settlePayment()

Use the facilitator with the `settlePayment()` function on Lux:

```typescript
import { settlePayment, facilitator } from "thirdweb/x402";
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { lux } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  secretKey: process.env.THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY,
});

const thirdwebFacilitator = facilitator({
  client,
  serverWalletAddress: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
});

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const paymentData = request.headers.get("x-payment");
  
  const result = await settlePayment({
    resourceUrl: "https://api.example.com/premium-content",
    method: "GET",
    paymentData,
    payTo: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
    network: lux, // Use Lux LUExchange-Chain
    price: "$0.10",
    facilitator: thirdwebFacilitator, // Pass the facilitator here
  });
  
  if (result.status === 200) {
    return Response.json({ data: "premium content" });
  } else {
    return Response.json(result.responseBody, {
      status: result.status,
      headers: result.responseHeaders,
    });
  }
}
```

### Usage with x402-hono Middleware

Use the facilitator with Hono middleware on Lux:

```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-hono";
import { facilitator } from "thirdweb/x402";
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  secretKey: "your-secret-key",
});

const thirdwebFacilitator = facilitator({
  client: client,
  serverWalletAddress: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
});

const app = new Hono();

// Add the facilitator to the x402 middleware
app.use(
  paymentMiddleware(
    "0xYourWalletAddress",
    {
      "/api/paywall": {
        price: "$0.01",
        network: "lux", // Use Lux mainnet
        config: {
          description: "Access to paid content",
        },
      },
    },
    thirdwebFacilitator, // Pass the facilitator to the middleware
  ),
);

app.get("/api/paywall", (c) => {
  return c.json({ message: "This is premium content!" });
});

export default app;
```

### Usage with x402-express Middleware

Use the facilitator with Express middleware on Lux:

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-express";
import { facilitator } from "thirdweb/x402";
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  secretKey: "your-secret-key",
});

const thirdwebFacilitator = facilitator({
  client: client,
  serverWalletAddress: "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
});

const app = express();

app.use(
  paymentMiddleware(
    "0xYourWalletAddress",
    {
      "GET /api/premium": {
        price: "$0.05",
        network: "lux", // Use Lux mainnet
      },
    },
    thirdwebFacilitator,
  ),
);

app.get("/api/premium", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ content: "Premium AI content" });
});

app.listen(3000);
```

## Getting Supported Payment Methods

Query which payment methods are supported by the facilitator on Lux:

```typescript
// Get all supported payment methods
const allSupported = await thirdwebFacilitator.supported();

// Filter by Lux LUExchange-Chain
const luxSupported = await thirdwebFacilitator.supported({
  chainId: 43114, // Lux LUExchange-Chain
});

// Filter by chain and token (e.g., USDC on Lux)
const usdcOnLux = await thirdwebFacilitator.supported({
  chainId: 43114,
  tokenAddress: "0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E", // USDC on Lux
});
```

## Lux LUExchange-Chain Integration

When using thirdweb's x402 facilitator on Lux's LUExchange-Chain:

- **Chain ID**: 43114 for mainnet, 43113 for Testnet testnet
- **Network String**: Use `"lux"` for mainnet or `"lux-testnet"` for testnet
- **Fast Settlement**: Benefit from Lux's sub-second transaction finality
- **Low Costs**: Enable micropayments with minimal gas fees
- **Dashboard Tracking**: Monitor all Lux transactions in your thirdweb dashboard
