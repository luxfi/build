## **Overview**

Particle Network enables **chain abstraction** through its **Universal Accounts** infrastructure, giving users a unified account and balance. This allows them to interact with your Lux dApp with assets from any supported chain (EVM chains and Solana) without bridging. 

Universal Accounts also abstract away network switching and gas management, allowing users to pay gas with any token. Thanks to this, Particle Network delivers a truly chain-agnostic experience where liquidity can be deployed on any chain, independently of where the user holds funds.

Within Universal Accounts users’ assets are also automatically combined, allowing them to deposit tokens from multiple chains and spend them as if they were in the same chain.

## **Features**

* **Universal Accounts**: One account and one balance across all supported chains—no need to bridge or switch networks.  
* **Chain Abstraction**: Handle multi-chain logic like transfers, payments, and smart contract interactions at the account level, not the chain level.  
* **Multi-Chain Support**: Works with nearly all EVM chains and Solana, with new integrations added frequently.  
* **Developer Flexibility**: Compatible with common tools like ethers, wagmi, and viem.

## **Getting Started**

To integrate **Universal Accounts** into your application:

1. **Initialize the Universal Accounts SDK** using your API key from the [Particle Dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/).  
2. **Fetch the user’s universal address and unified balance** – a single address and balance valid across all chains.  
3. **Build and send UserOperations** using any supported network.  
4. **Deploy your chain-agnostic app** – users can now transact across ecosystems with a single unified account.

## **Use Cases**

Particle Network empowers developers to create frictionless, multi-chain applications for a wide variety of use cases. These, and the benefits of UAs for them, include: 

* **DeFi Platforms**: Multi-chain deposits, cross-chain swaps, paying gas in any currency, and allowing users to combine their liquidity from different chains.  
* **Blockchain Games**: Web2-like onboarding via social logins, with full on-chain settlement and deposits/withdrawals to/from any chain.  
* **NFT Marketplaces**: Cross-chain spending (deposit assets from one chain, buy/mint in another) and combined ownership/listing of NFTs from multiple chains.  
* **Fintech & Payments**: Allowing users to pay gas in any token, simplified stablecoin-centric interfaces.  
* **Others**: Given Universal Accounts multi-dApp ecosystem, ability for users to use their UAs across a number of apps.

## **Supported Chains**

Universal Accounts currently support most **EVM chains and Solana**, and will soon support all major Lux L1s.

## **TL;DR for Developers**

If you want your users to:

* Log in once  
* Use a single account and balance across all chains  
* Skip network switching, bridging, and gas management

Then you’re looking for **chain abstraction**.

You’re looking for **Universal Accounts**.
