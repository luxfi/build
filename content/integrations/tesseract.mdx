## Overview

Tesseract is Lux's premier liquidity marketplace, designed to move and swap assets across Lux and its growing ecosystem of L1s at lightning speed. Built using Lux Interchain Messaging (ICM) and Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT) technology, Tesseract is a trustless, non-custodial, on-chain trading platform that seamlessly connects liquidity between the LUExchange-Chain and Lux's expanding network of Layer 1 blockchains.

By tapping into the entire Lux liquidity ecosystem, LUExchange-Chain and Lux L1 users benefit from getting the best prices on their trades. The platform eliminates the need for L1 operators to deploy their own DEX or manage liquidity pools themselves—with a simple integration, they can access Lux's deep liquidity instantly.

Tesseract is an Lux-native protocol built by the experienced contributors behind the successful Yield Yak platform, and has been audited by leading security firm OpenZeppelin, ensuring robust security and reliability.
