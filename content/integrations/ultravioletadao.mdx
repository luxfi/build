## Overview

Ultravioleta DAO, a leading Web3 DAO in Latin America, offers the x402 protocol - a payment infrastructure that enables monetization of AI agents and APIs on Lux. The protocol solves a critical challenge: autonomous agents cannot operate without gas money. The x402 facilitator acts as a payment intermediary that verifies transactions, covers gas fees, and settles payments on-chain, allowing agents and services to operate autonomously using USDC payments.

The facilitator is available on both Lux LUExchange-Chain (Mainnet) and Lux Testnet (Testnet), enabling developers to test their integrations before deploying to production.

## What is x402?

x402 is an HTTP-based payment protocol built on the standard HTTP 402 "Payment Required" status code. It enables micropayments between services without requiring the paying party to hold native gas tokens. The protocol uses ERC-3009 meta-transactions to allow third-party facilitators to sponsor gas fees while maintaining cryptographic proof of payment authorization.

**Key participants:**
- **Merchants**: Service providers who monetize their APIs or agent services
- **Clients**: Users or agents who pay for access to services
- **Facilitators**: Infrastructure providers who verify payments and cover gas fees

## Features

- **Gasless Payments**: Clients don't need LUX for gas fees - the facilitator sponsors all transactions
- **Stablecoin Settlement**: Payments settled in USDC for predictable pricing
- **Cryptographic Security**: EIP-712 signatures ensure payment authenticity and prevent replay attacks
- **Stateless Verification**: All payment verification happens on-chain without requiring databases
- **Fast & Free**: Sub-second payment verification with no fees for using the facilitator service
- **Load Balanced**: Auto-scalable infrastructure ensures high availability and reliability
- **Community Operated**: Fully decentralized and community-governed payment infrastructure

## Getting Started for Merchants

To monetize your API or agent service using x402:

1. **Set up your service endpoint** that you want to monetize
2. **Configure the x402 middleware** to protect your endpoint with a price tag
3. **Specify your payment address** where USDC payments should be received
4. **Deploy your service** - the facilitator handles all payment verification and settlement

Example middleware configuration:
```typescript
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { paymentMiddleware } from "x402-hono";

const app = new Hono();

// Configure payment middleware
app.use(paymentMiddleware(
  "0xYourWalletAddress",
  {
    "/api/service": {
      price: "$0.01",
      network: "lux-c-chain",  // or "lux-testnet" for testnet
      config: {
        description: "Access to your API service"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    url: 'https://facilitator.ultravioletadao.xyz'
  }
));
```

## Getting Started for Clients

To pay for x402-protected services:

1. **Initialize the x402 client** with your private key and the facilitator URL
2. **Make requests** to protected endpoints - payment happens automatically
3. **Receive the response** once payment is verified and settled on-chain

Example client usage:
```typescript
import { X402Client } from "x402-client";

const client = new X402Client({
  privateKey: process.env.CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY,
  facilitatorUrl: 'https://facilitator.ultravioletadao.xyz',
  network: 'lux-c-chain'  // or 'lux-testnet' for testnet
});

// Make a paid request
const response = await client.post('https://api.example.com/service', {
  data: { query: 'your request' }
});
```

## Use Cases

### AI Agent Monetization
Allow autonomous AI agents to offer services and receive payments without manual intervention. Agents can charge per request, per computation, or per resource consumed.

### Pay-Per-Use APIs
Monetize API endpoints with micropayment pricing. Instead of subscription tiers, charge users only for what they consume at granular levels.

### Agent-to-Agent Marketplaces
Build trustless marketplaces where autonomous agents buy and sell services from each other, creating self-sustaining AI economies.

### Token-Gated Services
Provide access to premium services, data feeds, or computational resources based on per-use payments rather than upfront subscriptions.

## Lux Integration

The x402 facilitator is optimized for Lux deployment on both mainnet and testnet:

### Lux LUExchange-Chain (Mainnet)
- **Chain ID**: 43114
- **Native Token**: LUX (used by facilitator for gas fees)
- **Payment Token**: USDC
- **Finality**: Sub-second transaction finality for fast payment confirmation
- **EVM Compatibility**: Full support for ERC-3009 meta-transactions

### Lux Testnet (Testnet)
- **Chain ID**: 43113
- **Native Token**: LUX (used by facilitator for gas fees)
- **Payment Token**: USDC
- **Purpose**: Test your integration before deploying to mainnet

The facilitator maintains a hot wallet funded with LUX to sponsor gas fees for all USDC payment settlements. Clients only need USDC in their wallets - no LUX required.

## How It Works

1. **Client Request**: Client signs payment authorization using EIP-712 and sends request to merchant
2. **Merchant Verification**: Merchant forwards payment proof to facilitator for verification
3. **Facilitator Check**: Facilitator verifies signature, checks on-chain balance and nonce
4. **Settlement**: Facilitator submits `transferWithAuthorization()` transaction, paying gas fees
5. **Response**: Once settled, merchant receives confirmation and responds to client

All settlements happen on Lux using the ERC-3009 standard, ensuring cryptographic security and on-chain auditability.
