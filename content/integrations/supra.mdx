## Overview

Supra is a MultiVM Layer 1. It recorded 500k TPS on 300 nodes with sub-second consensus latency. It's the first chain with full vertical integration of native oracles, DVRF, bridging, automation creating a unified platform for building Super dApps.

## Features

- **Lightning Fast Speeds:** Get better data with near-instant refresh rates with full on-chain finality. We’re on track to become the world’s fastest-to-finality oracle Reaching finality in 600-900ms.
- **Truly Decentralized:** Our oracles are designed to be decentralized at every level, from multi-source data collection to a globally distributed node network.
- **Toughened Security:** Our oracles are designed with a randomized node network along with inbuilt fail-safes to maximize security guarantees.
- **Natively Interoperable:** We’re blockchain agnostic and compatible with over 58 networks like Aptos, Arbitrum, Lux, Ethereum, Optimism, Polygon, and more.
- **Massive Scalability:** We've devised a novel consensus algorithm that can process hundreds of thousands of transactions per second without compromising security.

## Getting Started

1. **Start Building using Supra Oracle**: Refer to the [docs](https://docs.supra.com/oracles) to gain a deeper understanding and detailed guides on integration.
2. **Explore Supra's Layer 1**: Check [Docs](https://docs.supra.com/) to start building with the Full Supra Stack.
3. **Supra dVRF**: Integrate [Supra dVRF](https://docs.supra.com/dvrf/build-with-supra-dvrf/getting-started) for tamper-proof, unbiased, and cryptographically verifiable random numbers to be employed by smart contracts.
4. **Supra Automation**: Check Supra's block level [Automation Docs](https://docs.supra.com/automation) to create financial systems that are responsive, intelligent, and user-friendly without sacrificing decentralization.
5. **SupraNova Bridge**: SupraNova is a cross-chain communication framework developed by Supra. Check [Docs Here](https://docs.supra.com/supranova)
