## Overview

Chaos Labs Oracles is a decentralized oracle protocol built for real-time risk management, delivering unified data feeds that include prices, risk parameters, and proof of reserves. The platform provides high-precision, low-latency price data with built-in risk filtering and real-time anomaly detection, consuming fresh data 5× per second to capture every market move. With ultra-low latency and continuous quality control, Chaos Oracles ensures only clean, trustworthy inputs power onchain systems. The protocol features real-time risk tuning that maximizes security and capital efficiency through automated risk parameter adjustments, governance-safe automation within defined bounds, and verifiable proof of reserves with tamper-resistant attestations published onchain for complete transparency.
