## Overview

Ethena is a synthetic dollar protocol that provides USDe, a crypto-native stable asset designed to offer stability without reliance on traditional banking infrastructure. Through delta-neutral hedging strategies using staked assets and derivatives positions, Ethena creates a scalable, censorship-resistant stablecoin that also offers yield opportunities to holders through its sUSDe staked variant.

## Features

- **Synthetic Dollar (USDe)**: Crypto-native stablecoin backed by delta-neutral positions
- **Internet Bond (sUSDe)**: Staked USDe that earns protocol yield
- **Delta-Neutral Design**: Stability maintained through hedged positions rather than fiat reserves
- **Censorship Resistant**: No reliance on traditional banking for backing
