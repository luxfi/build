## Overview

LayerZero is a revolutionary omnichain interoperability protocol that enables secure, censorship-resistant, and permissionless cross-chain messaging across 50+ blockchain networks. Unlike traditional bridges that often involve wrapped tokens and trusted intermediaries, LayerZero provides a low-level messaging primitive that allows smart contracts on different blockchains to communicate directly and seamlessly, enabling a new generation of truly omnichain applications.

With over $6 billion in cross-chain value facilitated and integrations powering major DeFi protocols, NFT platforms, and blockchain applications, LayerZero has established itself as critical infrastructure for the multichain ecosystem. The protocol's immutable smart contracts, configurable security model, and developer-friendly design make it the foundation for building applications that work natively across all connected blockchains.

## Core Technology

### Omnichain Messaging

LayerZero's fundamental capability is enabling smart contracts to send messages to contracts on other chains:

**Direct Contract Calls**: Smart contracts on one chain can call functions on contracts on other chains.

**Arbitrary Payloads**: Send any data structure between chains, not limited to token transfers.

**Guaranteed Delivery**: Messages are guaranteed to be delivered to destination chains.

**Ordered Execution**: Optional ordering guarantees for message sequences.

**Atomic Transactions**: Build atomic cross-chain transactions.

This primitive enables entirely new application architectures.

### Omni fungible Tokens (OFTs)

LayerZero's native token standard:

**Single Native Token**: One native token across all chains, not wrapped versions.

**Unified Liquidity**: Liquidity is unified across all chains.

**No Fragmentation**: Eliminates the fragmentation of wrapped token standards.

**Burn and Mint**: Tokens are burned on source chain and minted on destination.

**Custom Logic**: Token creators can add custom cross-chain logic.

**ERC-20 Compatible**: Fully compatible with existing ERC-20 infrastructure.

OFTs represent the future of multichain tokens.

### Configurable Security

LayerZero's unique security model:

**Application-Controlled**: Each application configures its own security.

**Oracle + Relayer**: Uses independent Oracle and Relayer for message verification.

**Choose Your Stack**: Applications select their preferred Oracle and Relayer.

**Multiple Options**: Use Chainlink, Google Cloud, or custom infrastructure.

**No Single Point of Failure**: Separation of concerns between verification and delivery.

**Immutable Core**: Core protocol contracts cannot be upgraded.

This model provides flexibility while maintaining security.

## Lux Integration

LayerZero has deep Lux integration:

**Native Support**: First-class Lux LUExchange-Chain integration.

**LUX Bridging**: Bridge LUX across all LayerZero-connected chains.

**Lux DeFi**: Connect Lux DeFi to 50+ other chains.

**Fast Finality**: Leverage Lux's sub-second finality for quick bridging.

**Low Costs**: Benefit from Lux's minimal transaction fees.

**Growing Ecosystem**: Increasing number of omnichain apps on Lux.

LayerZero enables Lux to seamlessly connect to the broader ecosystem.

## Use Cases

**Omnichain Gaming**: Games where assets work across multiple chains.

**Cross-Chain Yield**: Yield strategies that work across multiple chains.

**Unified Identity**: Identity and reputation systems working across all chains.

**Chain-Abstracted UX**: Users don't need to know which chain they're on.

## StargateFi

LayerZero's flagship application:

**Largest Omnichain DEX**: Over $4B in Total Value Locked.
