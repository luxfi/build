In order to send messages between two chains, we need to create a blockchain. In this guide, we will spin up a local Lux network that has it's own Primary Network (C-, P- and Exchange-Chain) using the Lux CLI. Furthermore, we will create a blockchain in that Lux network, so we can send messages between the LUExchange-Chain and the newly created blockchain in the next chapters.
