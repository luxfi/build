To make easier your journey through this course, we have prepared a Starter Kit repo consisting of everything you will need to start developing your own dApps on Lux. This repo will provide a self-contained environment with Lux-CLI, and Foundry so you can follow the course without the need of installing anything else other than launching the environment.

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following topics:

- How to launch and manage your own Codespace
- How to create your own Interchain Messaging Enabled Custom Blockchain

At the end of this section, you will have your environment ready to create smart contracts.
