Now it's time to deploy your NFT smart contract to the Lux network and mint your first NFT!

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

### Core Wallet Extension

You'll need the Core browser extension to fund and deploy your contract. If you haven't installed it yet:

1. Download [Core Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/core-crypto-wallet-nft-ex/agoakfejjabomempkjlepdflaleeobhb)
2. Create or import a wallet
3. Enable **Testnet Mode**:
   - Go to **Settings** → **Advanced**
   - Turn on **Testnet Mode**
   - Core will automatically switch to Testnet Testnet

<Callout type="info">
**Other Wallets**: If using MetaMask or another wallet, add Testnet Testnet manually:
- **Network Name**: Lux Testnet LUExchange-Chain
- **RPC URL**: `https://api.lux-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc`
- **Chain ID**: `43113`
- **Symbol**: LUX
- **Explorer**: `https://testnet.snowtrace.io`
</Callout>

### Testnet LUX

You'll need LUX on the Testnet testnet to pay for gas fees.

**Option 1 (Recommended)**: 
- Create a [Lux Build account](https://build.lux.network/login)
- Connect your wallet to receive testnet LUX automatically

**Option 2**: 
- Use the [Lux Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/)
- If you have LUX on Mainnet, paste your LUExchange-Chain address and request test tokens
- Otherwise, request a faucet coupon on [Guild](https://guild.xyz/lux)

## Deploying with Remix IDE

[Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) is a browser-based Solidity compiler that makes it easy to compile and deploy smart contracts without installing any software.

### Step 1: Compile Your Contract

After importing your contract from OpenZeppelin Wizard:

1. Click the **Compile** button on the left sidebar (or press `Ctrl/Cmd + S`)
2. Wait for the green checkmark to appear

<Callout type="info">
You may see options to "Publish on IPFS" or "Publish on Swarm" - these aren't necessary for this tutorial.
</Callout>

### Step 2: Configure Deployment

1. Click the **Deploy & Run Transactions** tab (bottom icon on left sidebar)

![Remix Deploy Page](/images/nft-collection9.png)

2. Change the **Environment** dropdown to **Injected Provider - MetaMask**

![Remix Web3](/images/nft-collection10.png)

3. Core will prompt you to connect - approve the connection

4. Verify the connection by checking that the **Account** matches your Core address

### Step 3: Select Your Contract

In the **Contract** dropdown, select your contract (it will have the name you gave it in the wizard).

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Click the orange **Deploy** button
2. Core will open and ask you to confirm the transaction
3. Review the gas fee and click **Confirm**

![Core Accept](/images/nft-collection14.png)

4. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed

Your deployed contract will appear under **Deployed Contracts**:

### Step 5: Verify on Snowtrace

1. Copy your contract address from Remix
2. Open [Snowtrace Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/)
3. Paste the address in the search bar

You'll see your contract information, including the deployment transaction:

## Minting Your First NFT

Now that your contract is deployed, let's mint an NFT!

### Step 1: Access the safeMint Function

1. In Remix, expand your deployed contract
2. You'll see a list of available functions

![Remix Functions](/images/nft-collection17.png)

3. Click the dropdown arrow next to **safeMint** to expand it

### Step 2: Mint to Your Address

1. Copy your Core wallet address
2. Paste it into the `to` address field
3. Click the orange **transact** button

<Callout type="info">
You can mint to any address, not just your own. This is useful for gifting NFTs or airdrops!
</Callout>

4. Confirm the transaction in Core
5. Wait for the green checkmark in the Remix terminal

### Step 3: Verify the Mint

1. Return to your contract page on Snowtrace
2. Refresh the page
3. You should see a new transaction for `safeMint`

![Snowtrace Mint](/images/nft-collection20.png)

4. Click on the [TX Hash](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/tx/0x8b698ac72bd20b2a640167c5d9bacdcbb3d86fd696eb8cde6f28347f6f99a2c9) to view details

Congratulations! You've successfully minted your first NFT! 🎉

## Viewing Your NFT

Your NFT is now:
- Recorded on the Lux blockchain
- Owned by your wallet address
- Linked to your metadata and image on IPFS

You can view it:
- On Snowtrace (under the "Token Transfers" tab)
- In your Core wallet (NFT section)
- On NFT marketplaces that support Lux testnet

## Deploying to Mainnet

When you're ready to launch your project on Mainnet, the process is identical except:

1. **Switch to Mainnet**: Disable Testnet Mode in Core
2. **Get Real LUX**: You'll need actual LUX to pay for gas fees
3. **Use Mainnet Snowtrace**: View transactions at [snowtrace.io](https://snowtrace.io/)
4. **List on Marketplaces**: Your NFTs can be listed on platforms like [Joepegs](https://joepegs.com/)

<Callout type="warn">
**Before Mainnet Deployment**:
- Thoroughly test your contract on testnet
- Consider a professional audit for valuable collections
- Ensure your IPFS files are permanently pinned
- Have a clear minting strategy and pricing
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Now that you've deployed and minted your NFT, you might want to:

- Mint additional NFTs from your collection
- Learn about token URIs and metadata standards
- Explore advanced features like royalties and allowlists
- Build a custom minting dApp for your collection

In the next section, we'll dive deeper into how token URIs work and how your NFTs connect to their metadata.
