Now that your NFT files are prepared, it's time to create the smart contract that will manage your NFT collection. We'll use [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/), a trusted library for building secure smart contracts.

## Why OpenZeppelin?

OpenZeppelin provides battle-tested, audited smart contract implementations that follow industry standards. Their [Contract Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721) allows you to generate customized contracts without writing code from scratch, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

## Using the Contract Wizard

### Step 1: Access the Wizard

Navigate to [wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/#erc721)

### Step 2: Select ERC-721

Make sure the **ERC-721** tab is selected. This will create a contract in the [Solidity programming language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/) specifically for non-fungible tokens.

### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

The wizard provides a template contract that you'll customize:

**Name**: Give your NFT collection a name (e.g., "Photography")
**Symbol**: Choose a short symbol for your collection (e.g., "FOTO")
**Base URI**: Paste the metadata folder URL you saved from Pinata

Example: `https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYdWxbiwsfsYcW1CYQPgYujAc9FMLPG3fgFcxFskbSsFa`

### Step 4: Add Minting Functionality

Check the following boxes to add essential features:

**Mintable**: Adds a `safeMint` function to create new NFTs
**Auto Increment Ids**: Automatically assigns sequential token IDs

This will automatically check **Ownable**, which restricts the `safeMint` function to the contract owner.

## Understanding the Generated Contract

Let's examine the key parts of your generated contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract Photography is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 private _nextTokenId;
    string private _baseTokenURI;

    constructor(address initialOwner)
        ERC721("Photography", "FOTO")
        Ownable(initialOwner)
    {
        _baseTokenURI = "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYdWxbiwsfsYcW1CYQPgYujAc9FMLPG3fgFcxFskbSsFa/";
    }

    function _baseURI() internal view override returns (string memory) {
        return _baseTokenURI;
    }

    function safeMint(address to) public onlyOwner {
        uint256 tokenId = _nextTokenId++;
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
    }
}
```

### Key Components

**Inheritance**: Your contract inherits from `ERC721` (the standard) and `Ownable` (access control)

**Constructor**: Sets the collection name, symbol, and base URI when deployed

**_baseURI()**: Returns the base URI that will be combined with token IDs to fetch metadata

**safeMint()**: Creates new NFTs and assigns them sequential IDs

<Callout type="info">
The `onlyOwner` modifier means only the contract owner can mint NFTs. For a public mint, you would remove this modifier and add payment logic.
</Callout>

## About the safeMint Function

The current `safeMint` function:
- Mints one NFT at a time
- Can mint to any address (not just the owner's)
- Charges no fee (except gas)
- Functions as an "airdrop" mechanism

This is perfect for:
- Personal collections
- Gifting NFTs
- Controlled distributions
- Testing your contract

For a public sale, you would modify this function to:
- Accept payment (e.g., `payable` with price checks)
- Remove the `onlyOwner` modifier
- Add supply limits
- Implement per-wallet minting limits

## Next Steps

Your smart contract is now ready! Click **Open in Remix** at the top of the wizard to prepare for deployment.

In the next section, we'll deploy this contract to the Lux network and mint your first NFT.
