In this course, you will learn how to deploy your own NFT (Non-Fungible Token) collection on the Lux network.

## Why Take This Course?

NFTs have revolutionized digital ownership, enabling creators to tokenize unique digital assets like art, collectibles, and more. This course will guide you through the entire process of creating and deploying an NFT collection, from understanding the ERC-721 standard to preparing your files and deploying your smart contract.

## Course Content

### ERC-721 Token Standard
Learn about the ERC-721 standard, the foundation for non-fungible tokens, and understand how it differs from fungible tokens like ERC-20.

### Preparing NFT Files
Discover how to prepare your NFT images and metadata files, and upload them to IPFS using Pinata for decentralized storage.

### Creating the Smart Contract
Use OpenZeppelin's Contract Wizard to generate a customized ERC-721 smart contract for your NFT collection.

### Deploying on Lux
Deploy your NFT collection to the Lux LUExchange-Chain using Remix IDE and mint your first NFT.

### Understanding Token URIs
Learn how token URIs work and how they connect your on-chain NFTs to their off-chain metadata and images.

## Prerequisites

### Blockchain / Web3
This course is meant for people with some experience in web3. You should be familiar with:
- **Wallets**: What they are and how to create one
- **dApps**: What a decentralized application is and how to interact with one
- **Transactions**: How to send and confirm blockchain transactions

If any of this is unclear, we strongly recommend taking the Blockchain Fundamentals course first.

### Software Development
You will need a general understanding of software development:
- **Programming**: Familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, functions, and data structures
- **Solidity Basics**: Understanding of smart contracts (covered in the Intro to Solidity course)
- **IDE**: Familiarity with web-based development tools like Remix

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the ERC-721 token standard and how NFTs work
- Prepare and upload NFT files to IPFS using Pinata
- Create a customized ERC-721 smart contract using OpenZeppelin
- Deploy your NFT collection to Lux LUExchange-Chain
- Mint NFTs from your deployed contract
- Understand token URIs and metadata standards
- View your NFTs on blockchain explorers

## Tools You'll Use

- **Pinata**: For storing NFT images and metadata on IPFS
- **OpenZeppelin Wizard**: To generate your ERC-721 smart contract
- **Remix IDE**: To compile and deploy your contract
- **Core Wallet**: To manage transactions and pay gas fees
- **Snowtrace**: To view your deployed contract and transactions
