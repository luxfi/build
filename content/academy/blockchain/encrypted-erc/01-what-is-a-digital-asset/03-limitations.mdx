The ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 standards have become the backbone of asset creation and exchange on Lux’s LUExchange-Chain, Testnet Testnet, and custom L1s. However, while they ensure interoperability and simplicity, they also present **important limitations** that companies and developers must address when building real-world solutions.

## 1. Privacy Limitations

All three standards: ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155, operate on **transparent ledgers**.  
- **Balances are public**: Anyone can view wallet holdings.  
- **Transactions are public**: Every transfer amount and counterparty is visible.  
- **Asset ownership is public**: For ERC-721 and ERC-1155, ownership history and metadata are fully transparent.  

This transparency is useful for auditability but problematic for:  
- Regulated financial institutions.  
- Enterprises managing sensitive transactions.  
- Use cases requiring trade secrecy or personal data protection.  

---

## 2. Compliance Challenges

Lux provides speed and low costs, but these standards **do not include compliance tools by default**.  
- No built-in **selective disclosure** for regulators or auditors.  
- No native mechanism to **restrict transactions** based on jurisdiction.  
- Compliance features must be built as **custom layers**, increasing development cost and complexity.

---

## 3. Scalability Concerns

While Lux’s architecture solves many scaling issues, token standards still introduce some constraints:  
- **ERC-20 and ERC-721**: Each transfer is a separate transaction, which can be inefficient for high-volume operations.  
- **ERC-721**: One contract per collection increases deployment and maintenance overhead.  
- **ERC-1155**: More efficient, but not all dApps and marketplaces fully support it yet.

---

## 4. Asset Management Limitations

- **Single-purpose contracts**: ERC-20 can only handle one fungible token per contract.  
- **No native multi-asset governance**: ERC-721 collections and ERC-20 tokens require separate governance or management systems.  
- **Limited metadata security**: Metadata for NFTs is often stored off-chain and can be altered unless proper safeguards are in place.

## Summary Table — Key Limitations on EVM Blockchains

| Standard | Privacy | Compliance | Scalability | Asset Management |
|----------|---------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| ERC-20   | No privacy, public balances & transfers | No built-in compliance | One transfer per transaction | Single token per contract |
| ERC-721  | No privacy, public ownership & metadata | No built-in compliance | One contract per collection | Separate governance per collection |
| ERC-1155 | No privacy, public ownership & metadata | No built-in compliance | Batch transfers supported, but partial ecosystem support | Multi-asset capable but complex |

These limitations do not prevent successful deployments, but they **create barriers for industries that require privacy, compliance-readiness, and advanced asset control**.

In the **next section**, we will explore **Real Privacy**: how much privacy blockchain truly offers, why compliance is critical, and how privacy-focused standards like **eERC** can address these challenges in the Lux ecosystem.
