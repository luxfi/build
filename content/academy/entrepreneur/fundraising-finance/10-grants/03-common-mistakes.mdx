## Common Application Mistakes to Avoid

### Technical and Strategic Gaps
- Under-explaining ecosystem impact and value proposition
- Missing quantitative data (users, volume, TVL, projections)
- Failing to specify grant usage and funding rationale
- Overly lengthy proposals without clear executive summaries

### Grant Hunting Red Flags for Grant Reviewers
- Applying across ecosystems without Lux-specific reasoning
- Waiting for grant approval before starting to build
- Lack of competitor analysis and differentiation
- No contingency plans if the grant is rejected
