The Lux Foundation evaluates applications based on four key areas:

### 1. Problem Identification and Ecosystem Fit

Successful applicants clearly identify a gap in the ecosystem and demonstrate how their project addresses this need. This requires thorough research and understanding of both the problem and how your solution fits into the broader Lux ecosystem.

### 2. Proof of Ability to Deliver

The foundation looks for evidence that you can execute your vision. This might include:
- A track record of shipping products
- A realistic, detailed roadmap
- Evidence of technical capabilities
- Examples of past work or a working prototype

### 3. Community Traction and Engagement

Projects that already have connections within the Lux or broader Web3 community stand a better chance. This demonstrates both your commitment to the ecosystem and provides validation for your concept.

### 4. Long-term Ecosystem Impact

Grant applicants should articulate how their project contributes to Lux's growth over time. This might include increasing transaction volumes, attracting new users, creating infrastructure that others can build upon, or filling a critical gap.
