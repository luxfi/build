A successful social media strategy for Web3 startups hinges on two critical concepts. First, determine whether social media will actually drive user acquisition for your business model. B2B companies might see limited impact, while B2C and those with strong network effects tend to benefit more.

Second, understand the supply and demand dynamics. As an early company, you lack existing demand and social capital. Don't pressure yourself to post frequently without purpose. Instead, focus on creating highly educational, informational, and shareable content that serves as a quality introduction to your project.

Remember: in the beginning, your relationship with your community is paramount. Use your brand account to interact with early users and reply to community members. The stronger your connection with early supporters, the more they'll naturally promote your project, creating compound growth.
