The first step in building successful Web3 products is identifying communities that actually need blockchain technology—not where it's merely trendy, but where people lack visibility, access, or ownership.

## Finding Your First Users

<span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>"We live in a very noisy and loud space, where the community of our users typically has some sort of direct access to the founders and developers of products, whether that's a Discord, whether a Telegram channel, whether that's on X as the public forum."</span> - [Michael Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeltmartin/), Codebase Lead at Lux Network

These communities often form in places like Discord, Telegram, and Twitter/X, where incentivized early adopters gather to discuss new solutions to their problems. A strategic approach is to start with geographic targeting, then narrow down to specific industries or sectors within that area.

When searching for your first users, look for places where traditional systems aren't serving people well—these are the communities most receptive to blockchain-based alternatives.
