Your product cannot exist in a meaningful, sustainable way unless you understand who your users are."</span> - [Michael Martin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaeltmartin/), Codebase Lead at Lux Network

### What Are User Personas?

User Personas are detailed profiles of your ideal users that help you understand their needs, behaviors, and pain points. In Web3, personas are particularly important because users interact with products differently than in traditional applications—often pseudonymously and with multiple roles (token holders, contributors, governance participants).

Creating accurate personas requires understanding where your blockchain solution genuinely solves problems, rather than just applying technology for the sake of following a trend. Effective personas help you build products that address specific needs in communities where traditional systems aren't working.
