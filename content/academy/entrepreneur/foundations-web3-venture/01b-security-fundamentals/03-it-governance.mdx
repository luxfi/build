### Key Components of IT Governance

Three critical governance components frequently overlooked by early-stage startups are:

### 1. Access Management

Access management determines who can access what resources within your organization. Many security incidents result from unauthorized access or overly lax permissions.

**Implementation tips:**
- Create a clear role-based access matrix for onboarding and offboarding
- Conduct regular access reviews
- Pay special attention to privileged accounts and credentials
- Implement the principle of least privilege

### 2. Change Management

Change management covers the entire process from writing code to deploying it in production. Without proper security integration, this process can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Implementation tips:**
- Map your entire development pipeline from code writing to production
- Ask yourself: "If this component is compromised, could it put the production environment at risk?"
- Implement approval processes for code changes on GitHub or GitLab
- Include security testing in your deployment pipelines

### 3. Vendor Management

With the rise of supply chain attacks, understanding and managing the security of your third-party dependencies has become crucial.

**Implementation tips:**
- Identify all third parties your system depends on
- Request security documentation like SOC2 reports or ISO 27001 certifications
- Evaluate the security posture of critical vendors
- Monitor for security incidents affecting your dependencies
