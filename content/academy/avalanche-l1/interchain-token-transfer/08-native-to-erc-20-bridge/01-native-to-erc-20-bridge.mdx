ICTT is also capable of bridging native tokens between any Lux L1s as ERC-20 tokens. This process involves using a `NativeTokenHome` contract on the source L1, and a `ERC20TokenRemote` contract on the destination L1. The `NativeTokenHome` contract will be used to bridge the native token to the destination L1 as an ERC-20 token.

This example will cover native to ERC-20 token bridging between Lux LUExchange-Chain and Echo, where we'll bridge the native asset, `LUX`, to Echo as an ERC-20 token.

### What we will do
1. Deploy `NativeTokenHome` on Lux LUExchange-Chain
2. Deploy `ERC20TokenRemote` on Echo
3. Register `ERC20TokenRemote` on Echo with `NativeTokenHome` on Lux
4. Perform a transfer of the native token on Lux to Echo as an ERC-20 token
