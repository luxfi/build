<Callout>
For this guide, we'll be using the Lux Testnet testnet, which already has a wrapped native asset (WLUX). If you're creating your own L1 blockchain, you'll need to deploy your own wrapped native asset first.

### Deploy NativeTokenHome

Use our toolbox to deploy the NativeTokenHome contract:

Make sure you have:
1. Connected your Core Wallet to the Testnet testnet
2. Have enough test LUX for gas fees
3. Select "Native Token" as the transferrer type in the toolbox
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113}>

### Save the Native Token Home Address

After deployment, you'll need to save the contract address for future steps. You can find it in the deployment confirmation in the toolbox.
