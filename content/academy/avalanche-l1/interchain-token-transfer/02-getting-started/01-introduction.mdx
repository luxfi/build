# Getting Started with Interchain Token Transfer

In this section, we'll help you get started with our Interchain Token Transfer toolbox. We've made it easier than ever to transfer assets across Lux chains by providing a user-friendly interface that handles all the complexity for you.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A modern web browser with Core Wallet installed
   - Download Core Wallet from [core.app](https://core.app)
   - Create or import your wallet
   - Add the following testnet chains to your wallet:
     - Testnet LUExchange-Chain****
     - Echo
     - Dispatch

2. Test tokens for development
   - **Recommended:** Create a [Lux Build account](https://build.lux.network/login) and connect your wallet to receive testnet tokens automatically
   - **Alternative:** Get test LUX from external faucets like [core.app/tools/testnet-faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with code `lux-academy`

3. Basic understanding of how to use Core Wallet
   - Adding networks
   - Managing accounts
   - Approving transactions

4. An understanding of Lux networks and how to connect to them

<Callout type="warning">
This course focuses on using the existing testnet chains (Testnet LUExchange-Chain, Echo, and Dispatch). If you want to create your own L1 blockchain, please refer to the [Creating an L1](/academy/lux-l1/lux-fundamentals/04-creating-an-l1/01-creating-an-l1) course.

Since Interchain Token Transfer relies on Interchain Messaging (ICM), you must run your own relayer to enable cross-chain communication. Follow the [Running a Relayer](/academy/interchain-messaging/10-running-a-relayer/01-running-a-relayer) course to set up your relayer.
