In this section, you will learn how to transfer USDC from Lux’s LUExchange-Chain to a new Lux L1 using Interchain Token Transfers (ICTT) and set it up to act as the **native token** on the new L1. This guide will take you through the steps of configuring a local network environment, deploying the necessary contracts, and transferring tokens.


<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a new blockchain and Deploy on Local Network

Use the **Lux CLI** to create a new blockchain where you will deploy USDC as the native token.


```bash
lux blockchain create myblockchain  
```
```bash
lux blockchain deploy myblockchain
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Acquire USDC On Testnet LUExchange-Chain

The address for USDC on Testnet LUExchange-Chain is [`0x5425890298aed601595a70ab815c96711a31bc65`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/token/0x5425890298aed601595a70ab815c96711a31bc65).
For convience we have already deployed a `TokenHome` to the LUExchange-Chain for USDC with the address [`0x546526F786115af1FE7c11aa8Ac5682b8c181E3A`](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0x546526F786115af1FE7c11aa8Ac5682b8c181E3A)

You can use the [Core Faucet to get some USDC](https://core.app/en/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=usdcc) on Testnet. 

```bash
export USDC=0x5425890298aed601595a70ab815c96711a31bc65
export USDC_HOME_C_CHAIN=0x546526F786115af1FE7c11aa8Ac5682b8c181E3A
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Deploy Interchain Token Transfer Contracts
Set up the remote transferer contracts for transferring tokens between the LUExchange-Chain and the newly created L1.
   
- `NativeTokenRemote` Contract on `myblockchain` 
```bash 
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK --broadcast --optimize --optimizer-runs 200 --constructor-args "($TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_L1, $FUNDED_ADDRESS, "1", $C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX, $USDC_HOME_C_CHAIN, 6)" "USDC" 100000000000000000000 0 lib/icm-contracts/contracts/ictt/TokenRemote/NativeTokenRemote.sol:NativeTokenRemote
```

_Note: When deploying the `NativeTokenRemote` contract on the L1, ensure that the **initial amount** matches the native token amount that was minted when the blockchain was created. This ensures consistency between the native token supply and the remote token counterpart._

```bash

```
</Step>
<Step>
### Granting Native Minting Rights to NativeTokenRemote Contract
To ensure that the `NativeTokenRemote` contract can mint native tokens on the L1 when USDC tokens are transferred from the `LUExchange-Chain`, the contract must be granted **minting rights**. This is done by adding the `NativeTokenRemote contract` address to the `Native Minter Precompile`.

1. You will need to interact with the `Native Minter Precompile`, which resides at a fixed address on all Lux L1s:  
**Native Minter Precompile Address**: `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001`
     
2. Use the following command to grant the `NativeTokenRemote` contract minting rights by setting it as an **enabled** address on the Native Minter Precompile:
  
```bash
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK 0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000001 "setEnabled(address)" $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1
```

- `$NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1`: The deployed address of the `NativeTokenRemote` contract on your L1.

Once this step is completed, the `NativeTokenRemote` contract will have the necessary permissions to mint native tokens when USDC tokens are transferred from the LUExchange-Chain.
</Step>
<Step>
### Register Remote Token with Home Transferer
Register the remote token on the home chain so that it recognizes the transferer contracts.

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 "registerWithHome((address, uint256))" "(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0)"
```
</Step>
<Step>
### Collateralize and Transfer Tokens
Add collateral to the transferer contract on the home chain, and then send the USDC tokens across chains.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What is Collateral?">
Collateral in this context refers to the amount of the token that is locked in the `Home Transferer contract` on the source chain (`LUExchange-Chain`) to back the value of the token on the destination chain (`myblockchain`). This ensures that for every token minted on the remote chain, there’s an equivalent token locked as collateral on the home chain.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why is Collateral Important?">
Collateralization ensures that the total supply of the token remains consistent across both chains. When tokens are sent from the `home chain`, they are locked as collateral, and a corresponding number of tokens is minted on the remote chain. If tokens are sent back to the home chain, the collateral is unlocked, and the minted tokens on the remote chain are burned.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

- **Approve Tokens for Transfer**  
Approve a certain number of tokens to be used by the Home Transferer. 

```bash  
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $USDC "approve(address, uint256)" $USDC_HOME_C_CHAIN 2000000000000000000000
```

- **Add Collateral and Send Tokens**  
Add collateral to the transferer contract.
```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $USDC_HOME_C_CHAIN "addCollateral(bytes32, address, uint256)" $L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 100000000000000000000
```
You can also confirm whether the Transferer is collateralized now by running the below command:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url myblockchain $NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1 "isCollateralized()(bool)"
```
Send tokens to the L1
```bash 
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $USDC_HOME_C_CHAIN "send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address), uint256)" "(${L1_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${NATIVE_TOKEN_REMOTE_L1}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${USDC}, 0, 0, 250000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)" 1000000000000000000000
```
</Step>

<Step>
Check Balance
```bash
cast balance --rpc-url myblockchain $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```
</Step>
</Steps>

### Conclusion

Follow the steps above to transfer a USDC token from the LUExchange-Chain to your custom Lux L1 and use it as the native token. This exercise will demonstrate how Lux’s **Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT)** system works, ensuring that tokens are properly locked, transferred, and minted across multiple chains.
