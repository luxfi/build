## Transfer an ERC-20 Token &rarr; Echo as an ERC-20 Token

This chapter will show you how to send an ERC-20 Token from LUExchange-Chain to Echo using Interchain Messaging and Toolbox. This guide is conducted on the Testnet testnet, where we'll bridge tokens from LUExchange-Chain to Echo.

**All Lux Interchain Token Transfer contracts and interfaces implemented in this chapter implementation are maintained in the [`lux-interchain-token-transfer`](https://github.com/luxfi/lux-interchain-token-transfer/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/luxfi/lux-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The lux-interchain-token-transfer contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## What we will do

1. Deploy an ERC-20 Contract on LUExchange-Chain
2. Deploy the Interchain Token Transferer Contracts on LUExchange-Chain and Echo
3. Register Remote Token contract with the Home Transferer contract
4. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens
