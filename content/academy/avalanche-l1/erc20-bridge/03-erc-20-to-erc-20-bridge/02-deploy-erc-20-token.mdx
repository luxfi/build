### Deploy an ERC-20 Token

We've already deployed an ERC-20 token in the [Transfer an ERC-20 Token](/academy/interchain-token-transfer/03-tokens/08-transfer-an-erc-20-token) section. If you've completed that step, you can use the same token for this bridge.

If you haven't deployed a token yet, make sure you're connected to the Testnet testnet since we're covering this guide from Testnet to Echo. You can deploy the original ERC-20 token below:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper>
    <DeployExampleERC20 enforceChainId={43113} />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

<Callout>
Make sure to save the deployed token address as you'll need it for the next steps. You can find it in the deployment confirmation or by checking your Core Wallet's token list.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Add Token to Core Wallet

If you haven't already added the token to your Core Wallet:

1. Go to the Tokens tab
2. Click "Manage"
3. Click "+ Add Custom Token"
4. Enter the token contract address
5. The token symbol and decimals should be automatically detected
6. Click "Add Token"

<Callout>
Remember that you need to be connected to the Testnet testnet to see and interact with your token.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Verify Token Balance

To verify your token balance:

1. In Core Wallet, select your token from the token list
2. The balance should be displayed
3. You can also check the token balance on the [Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io) by entering your address

<Callout>
If you deployed the example token, you should see a balance of 10,000,000,000 tokens in your wallet.
