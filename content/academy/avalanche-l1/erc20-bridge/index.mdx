## ERC-20 to ERC-20 Bridge

Welcome to the **ERC-20 to ERC-20 Bridge** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of bridging ERC-20 tokens between Lux L1s using Lux Interchain Token Transfer (ICTT).

By the end of this course, you will have practical skills in deploying token bridges, understanding bridge security, and implementing multi-chain token transfers using Lux's native interoperability features.

### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, we recommend completing:
- [Interchain Messaging](/academy/lux-l1/interchain-messaging) - Foundation in cross-chain communication with ICM
- [L1 Native Tokenomics](/academy/lux-l1/l1-native-tokenomics) - Understanding tokens fundamentals

### What You'll Learn

This comprehensive course will walk you through:

- **Token Bridging Fundamentals** - Understanding bridge architecture, security considerations, and common bridge vulnerabilities
- **Lux Interchain Token Transfer** - Learning the ICTT protocol design, TokenHome and TokenRemote contracts
- **ERC-20 to ERC-20 Bridge** - Deploying your own token bridge, registering remote chains, and transferring tokens
- **Tokens on Multiple Chains** - Managing tokens across multiple L1s and implementing multi-hop transfers

### Let's Get Started!

Each section builds upon previous knowledge, so we recommend completing the course in order.

Happy learning and building!
