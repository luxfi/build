Before you start creating your first L1, we recommend you to create an Lux Builder Account. This will
allow you to easily access many features of Lux Build. You can complete the course without a Builder Account, but it will be much more convenient to have one.

### Benefits of a Builder Account

- **Faucet**: With a Builder Account, you can claim testnet LUX on the LUExchange-Chain and Platform-Chain right
  from the Builder Console without the need of a coupon code or holding a mainnet balance.
- **Free Managed Testnet Infrastructure**: With a Builder Account, we will provide free managed
    testnet nodes and ICM relayers for your L1. This infrastructure is not suitable for production use, but it is great for testing and development.
