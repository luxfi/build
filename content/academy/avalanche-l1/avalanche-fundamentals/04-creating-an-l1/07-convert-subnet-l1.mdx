The node you have just launched is tracking the Subnet but is not yet a validator. In fact, since the Subnet
does not have any validators yet it cannot process any transactions. In this step we will do two
things at once:

1. Convert the Subnet to an L1
2. Add your node as a validator

Converting a Subnet to an L1 requires the Subnet owner issuing a `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction
on the Platform-Chain. This transaction establishes a new validator set for your blockchain and transforms
it from a Subnet into a sovereign L1 chain. The `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction is a one-time
transaction that can only be executed once by the Subnet owner(s). 

After the conversion the subnet owner looses all privileges and the L1 is controlled by a validator
manager contract, that manages the validator set. You will learn more about this in the next
chapter. 

The `ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` has the following parameters:

- **Subnet ID** - The unique identifier of your Subnet
- **Validator Manager Blockchain ID** - The ID of the blockchain where the Validator Manager
  contract will be deployed. This blockchain can belong to the L1, be the LUExchange-Chain or belong to any
  other L1 in the Lux network
- **Validator Manager Address** - The address of the contract on that blockchain
- **Validators** - The initial set of validators for the L1

<Callout type="info">
The **Validator Manager Address** is initially set to an OpenZeppelin [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/proxy) contract pre-deployed in the `genesis.json`. After conversion, you'll deploy the actual `ValidatorManager` implementation contract and update the proxy to point to it.
