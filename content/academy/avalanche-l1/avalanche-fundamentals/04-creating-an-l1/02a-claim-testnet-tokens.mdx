**Automated Faucet:** Once you connect your wallet with a Lux Build account, testnet tokens are automatically sent to your wallet when needed. You can also manually request tokens using the buttons above.

## Alternative Faucet

If you don't want to create a [Lux Build Account](https://build.lux.network/login), you can use the external [Lux Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with coupon code `lux-academy` or `lux-academy25` to get 2 LUX on the LUExchange-Chain.

After you have claimed some LUX on the LUExchange-Chain, you can bridge it to the Platform-Chain using this tool:
