Now that we've gone over what Lux L1s are and how Interoperability works, you are probably eager to test out the
functionality of Lux L1s by creating one yourself! In this section, you will learn how to
create an L1  blockchain using the the Lux Builder Tooling. 

For production deployments you can leverage a [Blockchain-as-a-Service
Provider](/integrations#Blockchain%20as%20a%20Service) to oursurce the setup and maintenance of the
L1 infrastructure.

## What You Will Learn

In this section, you will go through the following steps:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Claim Testnet LUX Tokens 

In the first step we will show you how to set up the Core wallet chrome extension. After, we will
show how to claim some testnet LUX tokens from the faucet. Finally, you will learn how to bridge
the tokens from the LUExchange-Chain to the Platform-Chain.

</Step>
<Step>

### Create the Platform-Chain records for the a Subnet and blockchain

Here we will show you how to create the Platform-Chain records for the Subnet and the blockchain. You will
issue a `CreateSubnetTx` transaction on the Platform-Chain to create a Subnet record. Then you will add a belockchain to
the Subnet by issuing a `CreateChainTx` transaction on the Platform-Chain.

</Step>
<Step>

### Set up a node to track the Subnet

In this step you will learn how to set up a node to track the Subnet. We will leverage Docker to set
up a node on a cloud server. When the node is up and running, you will connect your wallet to it.

</Step>
<Step>

### Convert to an L1

To finish the process, you will convert the Subnet to an L1. This is done by issuing a
`ConvertSubnetToL1Tx` transaction on the Platform-Chain. This will turn your node into an actual validator
for the L1. 

</Step>
<Step>

### Test the L1

In the final step, you will deploy a ERC-20 token on the L1 you had launched.
