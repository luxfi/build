## Scalability of the Lux Network

Every blockchain has a limited capacity for computation and data storage. Therefore, the
transactions it can process in a given time frame and the state it can store are limited. In order
to scale horizontally and to offer more blockspace, we can just add more blockchains to the
Lux Network.



We can use the analogy of a highway to visualize this concept. A highway can only handle a certain
number of cars at a time. If too many cars try to enter the highway at once, traffic congestion will
occur and they have to wait to enter the highway. The idea is similiar to building many highways in
parallel and create additional space for cars to drive on. This allows for more transactions to be
processed in parallel, and therefore increases the overall throughput of the network.

The beauty of this approach is its simplicity. It doesn't require any new untested innovations. The challenge, rather, is optimizing how Lux L1s interoperate and making switching from one Lux L1 to the other easy.

## Independence From Other Lux L1s

Separating the ecosystem into different chains creates independence from another. If congestion
builds on one chain due to high network activity (e.g. an NFT drop, high volatility in token prices,
new game launched), other chains are unaffected. One chain's congestion or increasing fees won't
impact other chains. Going back to our highway analogy, we can think of the scaling through multiple
chains as building many short highways in parallel.



Coming back to our highway analogy, we can imagine a scenario where congestion builds up on one highway. The other highways are not directly affected. Some cars may choose to take a different highway and the traffic bottleneck may decrease.

In single-chain systems, like Ethereum, congestion and rising fees affect everyone, including parties
that have nothing to do with the cause of the activity increase. While the unified, or monolithic,
blockchain design does offer certain advantages (like unified liquidity, fewer bridges, and
potential for enhanced user experience via co-location of dApps), it also introduces notable
drawbacks. 

Validators must have powerful, costly machines to support a diverse array of applications, increasing centralization due to high operational costs of running a node. Lack of modularity can halt all on-chain activities during network disruptions, potentially causing significant financial losses. Additionally, each new dApp competes for the same block space as all others, leading to overcrowding.

## Customizability

The creator of an Lux L1 can customize it to meet their needs. This can happen in numerous
ways, including introducing a custom own gas token, using a different Virtual Machine (e.g. a WASM
or Move VM), or limiting access to the Lux L1. This is very hard to do in a single-chain
system because it would require a majority of users to agree.



In our highway analogy, let's think of some travelers having a very unique requirement: They would
like to travel by boat instead of a car. While technically possible to build a water lane on a
single highway system, this would be challenging. However, when these custom requirements are met in
a Lux L1, it's easy to do.

The ability to choose or create custom Virtual Machines (VMs) offers unprecedented flexibility.
Lux L1s allow for developers to have: 

- Multiple VM Support: Unlike single-VM networks like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Lux L1s can host
  multiple blockchain instances with different VMs.
- Ease of Use: Leverage existing VMs like the Subnet-EVM or create entirely new custom VMs using our
  SDKs to suit your specific needs.
- Network Effects: This flexible architecture creates network effects both within individual
  blockchains and across different Lux L1s and blockchains.

## Enhanced Privacy, Compliance and Access Control

While public blockchains offer transparency, many business scenarios require controlled visibility
of transaction data. Developers building an Lux L1 can optionally enable: 

- Selective Transparency: Private blockchains allow you to limit transaction visibility to
  authorized participants.
- Data Protection: Implement transaction encryption to safeguard sensitive information.
- Granular Access: Control which data is visible to which participants, supporting "need-to-know"
  access models.

## Interoperability

Lux L1s come with native interoperability and can leverage:

- Cross-Chain Communication: Facilitate seamless interaction between different custom blockchains in
  the Lux network leverage Lux Interchain Messaging.
- Asset Bridges: Create efficient bridges for asset transfers between your custom blockchain and
  other networks such as the Lux Interchain Token Transfer.
