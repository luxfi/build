In this activity, we'll interact with our first Lux L1. The Dexalot Lux L1 aims to replicate the user experience of a centralized exchange (CEX) with greater decentralization and transparency. By using a Lux L1, Dexalot can offer cheaper transaction fees than other traditional decentralized exchanges while keeping the transparency that centralized exchanges lack.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Display the Dexalot Lux L1 in Core

Make sure your Core Wallet is set to Testnet mode, so we do not use real funds. Open your Core Wallet Browser Extension and click "Show all Networks." To display Dexalot to our home screen, click the star icon next to its name.

### Bridge Tokens to Dexalot

Head over to the [Dexalot Testnet](https://app.dexalot-test.com/trade), connect your wallet (top right), and click on the `Deposit` button next to the pink icon with your connected wallet. You will have to authenticate your wallet for the first time you interact with Dexalot.

Once you clicked the `Deposit` button, select to deposit into the Dexalot L1. Enter 1 LUX and click Deposit. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

A few moments later, your balances should be updated and you should be able to see that on the `Dashboard` tab:

### Swap Tokens on Dexalot L1

Now head to the `Trade` tab and sell 0.5 LUX for USDC. You can select the trading pair LUX/USDC on the top right. The website will prompt your wallet to switch networks to the Dexalot L1. Confirm the switch and then sign the transaction.

## What just happened?

On the surface, it might feel like a regular decentralized swap. However, there is a substantial difference. We performed our operation not on the LUExchange-Chain, but bridged our tokens to a Lux L1, performed the operations there, and bridged our tokens back to the LUExchange-Chain.

The Lux L1 (Dexalot) we used was highly specialized for our use case and very cheap. We actually got all the gas token ALOT we needed airdropped, just for bridging assets over. The only fees we had to pay were for bridging. Usually, we would not have done this for a single operation, so these costs do not occur for a single trade, but only for depositing and withdrawing from the portfolio.
