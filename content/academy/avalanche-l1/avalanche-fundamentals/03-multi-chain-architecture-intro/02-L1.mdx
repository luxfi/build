> An Lux L1 is an independent blockchain with its own set of rules regarding validator membership, tokenomics,
and the execution layer. It has it's own validator set that comes to consensus and validates the blockchain. 



These specialized L1 blockchains can be tailored to meet specific needs for a variety of applications,
including DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and enterprise solutions.

- They specify their own execution logic.
- They determine their own fee structures.
- They maintain their own state.
- They facilitate their own networking.
- They provide their own security.

This independence ensures that L1s don't have to share execution threads, storage, or networking with other L1s networks or the Primary Network. 

## Lux Network

The Lux network is a network of independent interoperable L1s. They can communicate with
each other and assets can be transferred between them, while they maintain interoperability. As a result, the Lux network can:

- Scale up easily
- Achieve higher overall transactions per second (TPS)
- Offer lower transaction costs

By leveraging L1s, Lux creates a flexible and scalable ecosystem that can adapt to a wide range of use cases and requirements.
