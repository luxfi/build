## What is the Lux CLI?

The Lux CLI is a command-line tool that gives developers comprehensive access to Lux's functionalities, making it easier to build and test independent blockchains.

Each Lux network includes the Primary Network, which consists of the Contract (C), Platform (P), and Exchange (X) chains. It's important to note that "Primary Network" refers to a special Lux L1 rather than a distinct, standalone network.

Your local network operates independently from both the Mainnet and Testnet Testnet. You can even run an Lux L1 offline. Local Lux networks support, but are not limited to, the following commands:

- **Start and Stop a Network**: Easily start or stop a local network.
- **Health Check**: Check the health status of each node in the network.
- **Create Blockchains**: Spin up new blockchains with custom parameters.

Managing a local network with multiple nodes can be complex, but the Lux CLI simplifies the process with user-friendly commands.

## Usage

The Precompile-EVM repository comes preloaded with the Lux CLI and Foundry, so you don’t need to install additional tools when working within Codespaces. Just use the terminal in your Codespace to run Lux CLI commands and start building.
