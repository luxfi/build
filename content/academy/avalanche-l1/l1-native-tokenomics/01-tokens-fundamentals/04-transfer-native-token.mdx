In this exercise, you will learn how to transfer native tokens (LUX) between accounts using Core Wallet. We'll demonstrate this using the Testnet testnet.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Open Core Wallet

First, make sure you have Core Wallet installed. If you don't have Core Wallet installed already, click the Download Core Wallet button below.

</Step>
<Step>

## Get Test LUX

Before transferring tokens, ensure you have some test LUX:

**Option 1 (Recommended):** Create a [Lux Build account](https://build.lux.network/login) and connect your wallet to receive testnet LUX automatically on the LUExchange-Chain.

**Option 2:** Use the external [Lux Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with coupon code `lux-academy25` to claim LUX tokens on the LUExchange-Chain of the Testnet testnet.

</Step>
<Step>

## Transfer LUX

To transfer LUX to another address:

1. Click the "Send" button in Core Wallet
2. Enter the recipient's address
3. Enter the amount of LUX to send
4. Review the transaction details
5. Click "Send" to confirm

</Step>
<Step>

## Verify the Transfer

To verify the transfer was successful:

1. Check the transaction status in Core Wallet
2. View the transaction details on the [Testnet Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io)
3. The recipient can check their balance in their Core Wallet

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
Remember that you need to have enough LUX in your wallet to cover both the transfer amount and the gas fees. Always double-check the recipient address before sending to avoid any loss of funds.

Now that you know how to transfer native tokens, you can proceed to learn about transferring ERC-20 tokens in the next section.
