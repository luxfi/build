Welcome to the **L1 Native Tokenomics** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of how to create and manage native tokens on your own Lux L1 blockchain. 

By the end of this course, you will have practical skills in designing tokenomics, configuring native token allocation, and leveraging precompiles to create powerful token economies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have completed the [Blockchain Fundamentals](/academy/blockchain-fundamentals) and [Lux Fundamentals](/academy/lux-l1/lux-fundamentals) courses of the [Lux Developers Academy](https://build.lux.network/academy#:~:text=Choose%20Your%20Learning%20Path) learning tree.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- **Understand Token Fundamentals**: Gain deep insights into what tokens are, their differences, and the implications of creating native tokens versus ERC20 tokens.
- **Master Native Token Creation**: Learn how to create custom native tokens and understand when you need them versus when ERC20 tokens are sufficient.
- **Leverage Precompiles**: Understand how to use the Native Minter and Fee Config Precompiles to create powerful tokenomics.
- **Design Token Distribution**: Create effective vesting schedules, bonding curves, and airdrop strategies for your native tokens.
- **Implement Governance**: Develop governance structures including DAOs and quadratic voting models for decentralized decision-making.

But before diving into the technical implementation, we've included two essential think pieces to help you make informed decisions:

**Essential Reading**: [Dapp vs L1](/academy/lux-l1/l1-native-tokenomics/dappVsL1) - A critical analysis to determine whether your use case actually requires its own L1 with native tokenomics, or if deploying on an existing chain would be more appropriate.

**Highly Recommended**: [Token Ownership](/academy/lux-l1/l1-native-tokenomics/token-ownership) - Not strictly necessary for implementation, this deep dive into the philosophical and practical aspects of token ownership will give you a much richer understanding of the underlying concepts at play in tokenomics design.
