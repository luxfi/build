In the [Lux Fundamentals course](/academy/lux-l1/lux-fundamentals), you learned how to quickly set up an L1 using the [Developer Console](https://build.lux.network/tools/l1-toolbox). This section provides an in depth review of that flow, understanding what comes pre-configured in our genesis, and laying the foundation for what we will need for our Permissioned L1.

## Creating a Subnet

Let's create a fresh new Subnet that we can use during this course to test all of the tools and flows for managing Permissioned L1s.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Create Builder Account & Fund Wallet

Before creating your Subnet, we recommend setting up an Lux Builder Account for easier access to testnet resources.

<Button target="_blank" href="/login">Create Lux Builder Account</Button>

**Benefits of a Builder Account:**
- **Faucet**: LUExchange-Chain and Platform-Chain Testnet LUX directly sent to your account without needing to claim
- **Free Managed Testnet Infrastructure**: Access free managed testnet nodes and ICM relayers for your L1
- **No Docker Required**: Launch and manage nodes directly from the Builder Console without local setup

After creating your account:
1. [Download Core Wallet](https://core.app/) if not already installed
2. Set Core to Testnet mode (upper-right toggle button)
3. Visit the [Builder Console](/console) to claim test LUX on both LUExchange-Chain and Platform-Chain

</Step>
<Step>

### Create Subnet and Blockchain Records

Create the Subnet by issuing two transactions on the Platform-Chain (hence the need for test LUX on the P-chain).

These transactions are:
1. `CreateSubnetTx` - Creates a Subnet identified by the transaction hash
2. `CreateChainTx` - Adds a blockchain to the Subnet

For this guide, we will create our blockchain as an **uncustomized EVM** so you just need to rename it (if you want). 

On **Step 2: Create a Chain** select the *Genesis JSON* tab to the right and skim through it. No need to understand it all but good to get familiar with it before the next section.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="c-chain">
    <CreateChain embedded={true} />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

**Key Parameters:**
- **Subnet Owner**: P-chain address of your connected wallet
- **Chain Name**: Your blockchain's name
- **VM ID**: Default value `srEX...Dy` when creating with an uncustomized VM
- **Genesis Data**: Initial blockchain configuration

</Step>
<Step>

### Set Up Validator Node

Launch a node to track your Subnet. This node will become a validator for your Subnet, and later will be managed by the Validator Manager contract when we convert to L1.

Use our *free managed testnet infrastructure* - no Docker installation or AWS account required:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <CreateManagedTestnetNode />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

**Managing Your Nodes**

After creating nodes, you can view and manage them at the [Testnet Infrastructure Console](/console/testnet-infra/nodes).

<Callout type="warning">
Managed nodes automatically shut down after 3 days. For production or extended testing, see the self-hosted option below.
</Callout>

### Production & Extended Testing Environments

For production environments or extended testing periods, you should use Docker to run your nodes.

**Docker Setup Guide:**

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <LuxGoDocker />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Takeaways

- **Platform-Chain Registry**: All validators and blockchains are registered on the Platform-Chain
- **Subnet Foundation**: Your Subnet provides the blockchain infrastructure necessary for this course
- **Managed Infrastructure or Self-Hosted**: Lux Build provides free managed testnet nodes,
  eliminating the need for Docker or AWS setup - you can also choose to run it yourself.

## Optional Alternative: Self-Hosted Infrastructure

The free managed testnet nodes are a great option for playing around with Lux L1s, but are not
intended for running on production environments. They are shut down automatically after 3 days. If you want to test out your production environment, running beyond 3 days, or anything more complex you should run nodes on your own infrastructure
using Docker:

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="testnet-mainnet">
    <LuxGoDocker />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>
