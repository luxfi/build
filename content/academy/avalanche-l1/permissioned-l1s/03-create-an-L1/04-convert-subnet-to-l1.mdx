Now that you understand where to deploy your Validator Manager Contract (VMC), and you [created a Subnet](/academy/permissioned-l1s/03-create-an-L1/01-create-subnet) with at least one validator node, it's time to convert your Subnet into a sovereign L1. 

This process establishes the VMC as the authority for validator management on your blockchain and is **irreversible**, once converted to L1, you cannot revert to Subnet status.

## Conversion Process

The conversion from Subnet to L1 is a one-time, irreversible process that:

- **Establishes Sovereignty**: Your blockchain becomes independent with its own validator set
- **Transfers Authority**: Validator management shifts from Platform-Chain to your VMC

## Key Parameters

1. **Subnet ID**: The unique identifier of your Subnet (from the `CreateSubnetTx` transaction hash)

2. **Validator Manager Blockchain ID**: The blockchain where your VMC will be deployed (Your L1, LUExchange-Chain, Another L1)

3. **Validator Manager Address**: The address of the validator manager contract (or proxy) that will manage the L1's validator set. Chains created with Developer Console have a pre-deployed proxy at `0xfacade0000000000000000000000000000000000`.

4. **Initial Validators**: The validators that will form your L1's initial validator set. Add the validator we just spun up in the Create a Subnet section.

You just converted your Subnet to an L1  - **Congratulations!** The following sections will guide you through deploying and configuring your Validator Manager Contract.
