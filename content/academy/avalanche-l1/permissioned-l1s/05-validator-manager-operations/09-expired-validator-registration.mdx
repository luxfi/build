## Understanding Expired Validator Registrations

When validators are registered through the Validator Manager contract, they are given a **24-hour window** to complete their registration on the Platform-Chain. If this window expires without completion, the registration becomes invalid but remains in the pending registrations list.

Expired validator registrations typically occur due to configuration errors or manual mistakes during the registration process that prevent proper Platform-Chain registration.

These registrations create contract clutter by remaining in the pending list indefinitely, making it difficult to identify valid pending registrations.

## Removing Expired Registrations

This tool automatically identifies registrations past their expiry time and removes them from the pending list to keep your validator management system organized.

When removing an expired registration, the tool builds the required justification for Platform-Chain removal, signs the removal message using the appropriate signing mechanism, executes the `completeValidatorRemoval` function, and updates the contract state to remove the expired registration from the pending list.
