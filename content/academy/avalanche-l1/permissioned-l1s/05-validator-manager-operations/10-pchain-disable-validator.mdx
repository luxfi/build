We can directly disable a validator on the Platform-Chain using the `DisableL1ValidatorTx` transaction and without needing to go through the VMC flow.

### Why Direct Platform-Chain Disabling Exists

The direct disable flow is crucial for possible emergency situations like:
- The L1 goes down or becomes unreachable
- The Validator Manager Contract (VMC) is down or malfunctioning
- Something in the system is malfunctioning and immediate action is needed

These issues all become critical when the owner of the validators needs to retrieve their validator Platform-Chain LUX used to keep it running (e.g; they deposited 1000 LUX to never have to worry about topping up balances and now can't get it back)

### How It Works

**Direct Platform-Chain Transaction**: You can issue a `DisableL1ValidatorTx` directly on the Platform-Chain to disable any validator without interacting with the L1's Validator Manager contract at all.

**Weight Preservation**: When a validator is disabled this way, their weight still counts towards the L1's total weight - they're just inactive.

**Re-activation**: Disabled validators can be re-activated at any time by increasing their balance with an `IncreaseBalanceTx`. Anyone can call this transaction for any validator on the Platform-Chain.

**Key Management**: When a validator is disabled, the keys are no longer stored on disk, providing additional security.

**Permanent Removal Requires Contract**: To completely and permanently remove a validator from the set, you still need to call `initiateValidatorRemoval()` through the contract flow


### Chapter Conclusion

Throughout this chapter, we've explored the complete validator lifecycle - from adding validators through the VMC, modifying their weights, removing them properly, and handling emergency situations with direct Platform-Chain disabling.

This is all you will need to know in order to **manage the validator set of your permissioned L1**.
