The contracts in the [`validator-manager`](https://github.com/luxfi/icm-contracts/tree/main/contracts/validator-manager) branch define the Validator Manager used to manage Subnet-only Validators. 

For this section we have blurred out some of the contracts, as these are not relevant to the Proof of Authority hierarchy used to create a **permissioned L1**:

    +completeValidatorWeightUpdate()
    -_initiateValidatorRegistration()
    -_initiateValidatorRemoval()
    -_initiateValidatorWeightUpdate()
}
<<Abstract>> LP99Manager

class ValidatorManager {
    +initializeValidatorSet()
    +completeValidatorRegistration() onlyOwner
    +completeValidatorRemoval() onlyOwner
    +completeValidatorWeightUpdate() onlyOwner

    +initiateValidatorWeightUpdate() onlyOwner
}

## Understanding Contract Hierarchy

The validator management system follows a layered architecture, with each level adding specific functionality:

### LP99Manager (Abstract Foundation)

The `LP99Manager` is the foundational abstract contract that standardizes validator management for EVM-based L1s, as defined in [LP-99](/docs/lps/99-validatorsetmanager-contract). This standard emerged after [LP-77](/docs/lps/77-reinventing-subnets) introduced the protocol-level capability for L1s to manage their own validators. LP99Manager provides four essential functions that all validator managers must implement:

- **`initializeValidatorSet()`**: Establishes the initial validator set when converting an existing Subnet to an L1
- **`completeValidatorRegistration()`**: Finalizes validator addition after Platform-Chain confirmation
- **`completeValidatorRemoval()`**: Finalizes validator removal after Platform-Chain confirmation
- **`completeValidatorWeightUpdate()`**: Finalizes weight changes after Platform-Chain confirmation

These functions handle the critical interactions with the Platform-Chain through Warp messages, forming the backbone of cross-chain validator management.

### ValidatorManager (Concrete Implementation)

The `ValidatorManager` extends `LP99Manager` and adds the complete validator lifecycle management:

**Core Additions:**
- **`initiateValidatorRegistration()`** (onlyOwner): Starts the process of adding a new validator
- **`initiateValidatorRemoval()`** (onlyOwner): Begins removing a validator from the active set
- **`initiateValidatorWeightUpdate()`** (onlyOwner): Initiates changes to a validator's voting weight

**Key Features:**
- All state-changing functions are protected with `onlyOwner` modifier
- Implements the two-phase commit pattern: initiate → complete
- Manages churn rate limiting to prevent rapid validator set changes
- Tracks validator states throughout their lifecycle
- Handles Warp message construction and verification
