This section is **not necessary for understanding and running permissioned L1s** but provides an insight on the improvements and evolution of Lux, *feel free to skip if not interested*.

## Etna Upgrade: Making L1s More Accessible

The Etna upgrade, implemented through [LP-77](/docs/lps/77-reinventing-subnets), represents a fundamental shift in how Lux approaches network creation and validation costs.

### Why Etna Was Necessary

Before Etna, launching a Subnet (now called L1) was prohibitively expensive:
- **High Capital Requirements**: Each validator needed to stake 2,000 LUX (approximately $70,000 at the time)
- **Minimum Validator Costs**: With at least 8 validators recommended, projects needed $560,000+ just to launch
- **Primary Network Burden**: Validators had to sync and validate the entire Primary Network (Exchange-Chain, Platform-Chain, and LUExchange-Chain), requiring substantial hardware resources
- **Regulatory Barriers**: Organizations that couldn't validate permissionless chains were completely blocked from participating

### What Etna Changed

The upgrade introduced a continuous fee model that dramatically reduces costs:
- **Reduced Running Costs**: Validators now pay approximately 1.33 LUX per month instead of staking 2,000 LUX
- **No Primary Network Validation**: L1 validators only need to sync the Platform-Chain, significantly reducing hardware requirements
- **Pay-As-You-Go**: The continuous fee adjusts based on network usage, similar to cloud services
- **Regulatory Flexibility**: Organizations can now run L1s without validating the permissionless LUExchange-Chain

This transformation makes it feasible for startups, enterprises, and institutions to launch their own sovereign blockchains on Lux, opening the door to a new wave of innovation in permissioned and regulated blockchain applications.

## Evolution: From LP-77 to LP-99

While [LP-77](/docs/lps/77-reinventing-subnets) revolutionized how L1s work at the protocol level, it left one important question unanswered: How should smart contracts actually implement validator management? This is where [LP-99](/docs/lps/99-validatorsetmanager-contract) comes in.

### The Gap LP-77 Left

[LP-77](/docs/lps/77-reinventing-subnets) provided:
- **Protocol-level capabilities**: New Platform-Chain transactions and Warp message formats
- **The mechanism**: How L1s can send messages to update their validator sets
- **The foundation**: Basic rules for validator management

But it didn't specify:
- How to structure the smart contracts
- What functions and events to expose
- How to handle the complexity in a standardized way

### LP-99: The Standardization Layer

[LP-99](/docs/lps/99-validatorsetmanager-contract) fills this gap by defining a standard Solidity contract specification:

**Why Standardization Matters:**
- **Reduced Development Time**: L1 creators don't need to design from scratch
- **Security**: One audited implementation can benefit many L1s
- **Interoperability**: Tools and services can work with any [LP-99](/docs/lps/99-validatorsetmanager-contract) compliant L1
- **Best Practices**: Encodes lessons learned into a reusable standard

**The Three-Layer Architecture:**
1. **LP99Manager**: Abstract contract defining the standard interface
2. **ValidatorManager**: Concrete implementation with owner controls
3. **Access Control Layer** (like PoAManager): Defines who can manage validators

This progression from [LP-77](/docs/lps/77-reinventing-subnets) (protocol capability) to [LP-99](/docs/lps/99-validatorsetmanager-contract) (standardized implementation) mirrors successful patterns in blockchain development.
