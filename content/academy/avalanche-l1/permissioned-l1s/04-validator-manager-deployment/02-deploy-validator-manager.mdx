import DeployValidatorManager from "@/components/toolbox/console/permissioned-l1s/validator-manager-setup/DeployValidatorManager.tsx"

First you will need to deploy the actual Validator Manager implementation that contains the logic for managing validators. 

Building on the image shown in the introduction, now our L1 will have these contracts deployed:

## Implementation Contract

The Validator Manager implementation:
- Contains all validator management logic
- Implements the LP99Manager standard
- Handles Platform-Chain communication
- Can be upgraded without losing state

## Validator Messages Library

The ValidatorManager contract requires a separate library contract called **ValidatorMessages** to be deployed first. This library handles all the message encoding and decoding for communication with the Platform-Chain.

**Why a separate library?**
- Solidity requires libraries to be deployed independently before they can be linked
- The ValidatorManager bytecode contains placeholders that get replaced with the library's deployed address
- This allows multiple validator managers to share the same message handling code

**What it does:**
- Packs validator registration messages for the Platform-Chain
- Unpacks responses from the Platform-Chain 
- Handles weight updates and conversion messages
- Ensures consistent message formatting across all validator operations

<Callout type="info">
The library deployment is a one-time operation - once deployed, multiple validator manager contracts can reference the same library instance.
</Callout>
