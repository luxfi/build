## Validators in a Multi-Chain Network

Validators are nodes of a blockchain that secure the network by validating the transactions.
Each L1 in the Lux network has it's own set of validators that is running the `LuxGo` client.



All validators are registered on the Platform-Chain with a unique node ID, public key, and stake weight, mapped to the blockchain they are validating.



## Platform Chain (Platform-Chain)

The Platform Chain is the backbone for the native interoperability of the Lux network. It is a
registry of all validators in the Lux network. This includes the validators of the Primary
Network (including the X-, C- and Platform-Chain), as well as all L1s and legacy Subnet validators. The
following graphic shows a simplified data model of the Platform-Chain:

Builders can create new L1 blockchains in the Lux Network by issuing transactions on the
Platform-Chain. The Platform-Chain runs a special-purpose virtual machine called the
[platformvm](https://github.com/luxfi/luxgo/tree/master/vms/platformvm).

**It is not EVM-based and therefore to interact with it you need a compatible wallet like Core wallet.**

Creating new records for L1 blockchains on the Platform-Chain is done by issuing transactions like the `CreateSubnetTx` and `CreateChainTx`.

The Platform-Chain is secured by the Primary Network validators. L1 validators are syncing the Platform-Chain,
meaning they always have the latest view of the validator set of all blockchains in the Lux
network, but are not participating in the consensus of the Platform-Chain.
