### Finished Setup
Once your environment is set up, we can start building some applications using the AvaCloud API and the AvaCloudSDK. The home page should look like this:

### What We Will Build
Here is a brief overview of what we will be building in this course:

- ERC-20 Balance App
- Wallet Portfolio App
- Block Explorer App

Each of these applications will utilize the Data API to get data from the Lux network. We will fetch data such as ERC-20 token balances, NFT balances, recent transactions from an address, block information and much more.
