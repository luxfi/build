## Get an AvaCloud API Key

In order to utilize your accounts rate limits, you will need to make API requests with an API key. You can generate API Keys from the [AvaCloud portal](https://app.avacloud.io/glacier-api/).

<Steps>

<Step>
Create an account on [AvaCloud](https://avacloud.io).
</Step>

<Step>
Click on the `Web3 Data API` [tab](https://app.avacloud.io/glacier-api/).
</Step>

<Step>
Click `+ Add API Key` and create a new name for your API key.
</Step>

<Step>
**Save your API key** in a secure location. We will need it in the next step.
</Step>

</Steps>

Once you've created and retrieved the key, you will be able to make authenticated queries by passing in your API key in the `x-glacier-api-key` header of your HTTP request.

An example curl request to the Data API:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: Application/json" -H "x-glacier-api-key: <your_api_key>" \
  "https://glacier-api.lux.network/v1/chains"
```
