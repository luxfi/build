Alright, now let's send the message:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Send the Message:

```bash 
cast send --rpc-url testnet-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify Message Receipt

To check whether the message has been received, we can call the `roundtripMessage()` function on the sender contract. 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url testnet-c $SENDER_ADDRESS "roundtripMessage()(string)"
```
If successful, you should see the following output:
```bash
"Hello World!"
```

### Check the Relayer Logs

To understand in more detail what happened, check out the relayer logs:

```bash
lux interchain relayer logs
```
