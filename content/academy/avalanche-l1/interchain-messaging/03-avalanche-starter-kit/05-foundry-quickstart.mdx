Now that your environment is set up and funded, let's understand the key Foundry commands we'll be using throughout this tutorial.

## Understanding Foundry Commands

### forge create
The `forge create` command is used for deploying smart contracts. Key aspects:
- Requires an RPC URL to specify which network to deploy to
- Needs a private key for transaction signing
- Can handle constructor arguments if your contract needs them
- Returns the deployed contract's address
- Supports contract verification on block explorers

### cast send
`cast send` is used for state-changing interactions with contracts. This includes:
- Sending transactions that modify contract state
- Calling functions that require gas
- Approving token transfers
- Executing contract functions with parameters
- Requires private key for transaction signing

### cast call
`cast call` is for read-only operations that don't modify state:
- Reading contract state variables
- Calling view/pure functions
- Doesn't require gas or transaction signing
- Returns function results immediately
- Useful for verifying contract state

## Development Best Practices

1. Always test with small transactions first
2. Save contract addresses in environment variables
3. Double-check network configurations and addresses
4. Monitor transactions in block explorers
5. Keep private keys secure and never commit them
