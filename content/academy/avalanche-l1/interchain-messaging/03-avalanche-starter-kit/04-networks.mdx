Before you can deploy contracts or send transactions, you'll need test tokens on both the Testnet LUExchange-Chain and Dispatch networks.

## Getting Test Tokens

1. Open Core wallet and switch to Testnet Testnet:
   - Click the network selector (top of window)
   - Select "Testnet (LUExchange-Chain)"

2. Get test tokens:
   - **Recommended:** Create a [Lux Build account](https://build.lux.network/login) and connect your wallet to receive tokens automatically on LUExchange-Chain and Dispatch
   - **Alternative:** Use external faucets:
     - Testnet LUExchange-Chain: [Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) with code **lux-academy**
     - Dispatch: [Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=dispatch&token=dispatch)

3. Verify your balances inside of the codespace, you should have **2 LUX** and **2 DIS**:
```bash
# Check balance on Testnet LUExchange-Chain
cast balance $FUNDED_ADDRESS --rpc-url testnet-c

# Check balance on Dispatch
cast balance $FUNDED_ADDRESS --rpc-url testnet-dispatch
```

You can also check your balance from the core extension, don't forget to toggle **testnet mode** inside the advanced settings.
