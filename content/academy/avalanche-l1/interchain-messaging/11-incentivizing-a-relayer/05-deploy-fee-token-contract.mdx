To add incentives for relayers, we need an ERC20 token on the source chain (Testnet LUExchange-Chain). We'll deploy a simple ERC20 token that will be used to pay relayers for delivering our cross-chain messages.

<ToolboxMdxWrapper chain="testnet-c">
  <DeployExampleERC20 />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

<Steps>
<Step>

### Save the Token Address

After deploying the token through the interface above, save the token address to use it in the next steps:

```bash
export FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<your-deployed-token-address>
```

Replace `<your-deployed-token-address>` with the address shown in the interface after deployment.

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify Your Token Balance

You can check that you received the initial supply:

```bash
cast call --rpc-url testnet-c \
  $FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS \
  "balanceOf(address)(uint256)" \
  $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```

The balance should show 1,000,000 * 10^18 tokens (1,000,000 tokens with 18 decimals).

</Step>
</Steps>

These tokens will be used in the next sections to incentivize relayers to deliver your cross-chain messages.
