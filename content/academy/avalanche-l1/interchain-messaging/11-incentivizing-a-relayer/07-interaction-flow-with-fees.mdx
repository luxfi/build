Now we have all the Smart Contract 📜 set we can start sending incentivized cross-chain messages. Now let complete the flow 

- Deploy sender contract on **LUExchange-Chain**
- Deploy receiver contract on **Dispatch**
- Approve the sender contract to spend ERC20 funds from the message sender address
- Send the message

<Steps>
<Step>

### Deploy Sender Contract 

To deploy the sender contract run:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url testnet-c --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/incentivize-relayer/senderWithFees.sol:SenderWithFeesOnCChain --broadcast
```

```bash {6}
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠒] Compiling 2 files with Solc 0.8.18
[⠢] Solc 0.8.18 finished in 92.98ms
Compiler run successful!
Deployer: 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Deployed to: 0xa4DfF80B4a1D748BF28BC4A271eD834689Ea3407
Transaction hash: 0xb0ff20527818fcc0836944a13ddb3b336b95047d434bb52f6c064ab407950166
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Save the Sender Contract Address

```bash
export SENDER_ADDRESS=0xa4DfF80B4a1D748BF28BC4A271eD834689Ea3407
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Deploy Receiver Contract

Now, deploy the receiver contract.

```bash
forge create --rpc-url testnet-dispatch --private-key $PK contracts/interchain-messaging/incentivize-relayer/receiverWithFees.sol:ReceiverOnDispatch --broadcast
```

```bash {6}
[⠊] Compiling...
[⠢] Compiling 1 files with Solc 0.8.18
[⠆] Solc 0.8.18 finished in 105.36ms
Compiler run successful!
Deployer: 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC
Deployed to: 0xe336d36FacA76840407e6836d26119E1EcE0A2b4
Transaction hash: 0x379f0a4b875effc9b80a33f039d9a49404514e7aabaef4490f57b56fb4818f65
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Receiver Contract Address

```bash
export RECEIVER_ADDRESS=0xe336d36FacA76840407e6836d26119E1EcE0A2b4
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Approve ERC20 Token Expense

👩 The Message Sender (User) requires to approve the Cross-Lux L1 dApp as a spender on the ERC20 contract to be used as fee. We'll approve 0.0005 tokens (500000000000000 wei) from your total supply of 1,000,000 tokens which matches the fee amount set in the sender contract.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url testnet-c --private-key $PK $FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS "approve(address,uint256)" $SENDER_ADDRESS 500000000000000
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Send an incentivized message

```bash
cast send --rpc-url testnet-c --private-key $PK $SENDER_ADDRESS "sendMessage(address, string, address)" $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "Hello" $FEE_TOKEN_ADDRESS
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify message was received on Lux L1 

```bash
cast call --rpc-url testnet-dispatch $RECEIVER_ADDRESS "lastMessage()(string)"
```
```bash
"Hello"
```

**Success!** The message was received on the destination chain while incentivizing the Relayer.
