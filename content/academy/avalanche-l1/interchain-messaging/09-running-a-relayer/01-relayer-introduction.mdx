As you now know Interchain Messaging requires a running relayer to deliver the warp messages underlying it, so far we just assumed a relayer is running. However, in a production environment, you will either need to run a relayer yourself or have someone else run it for you.

![AWM Relayer data flow](https://qizat5l3bwvomkny.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/lux-build/course-images/teleporter/teleporter-source-destination-with-relayer-SvUFYGP77XxLjoyWqf7IpC85Ssxmmo.png)

In this section you will learn how to run a relayer for Lux Warp Messaging. As discussed in the section on AWM, the relayer is responsible for checking for outgoing warp messages on the source L1, aggregate the signatures and deliver it with a transaction on the destination L1.

This chapter utilizes the reference relayer implementation created by Lux Network. In this case the relayer is a standalone application written in Go. There may be different implementations in the future that are adapted to special use cases. Anyone can build and run a relayer.

## What you will learn

In this section, you will learn how to:

- **Configure the Relayer:** Create and understand the relayer configuration file that defines which blockchains to monitor and how to interact with them
- **Set Up the Relayer Wallet:** Learn about the relayer's wallet requirements and how to fund it with testnet tokens
- **Run the Relayer:** Deploy and operate the ICM relayer using Docker
- **Monitor Message Delivery:** Track and verify cross-chain message delivery through relayer logs and blockchain transactions
