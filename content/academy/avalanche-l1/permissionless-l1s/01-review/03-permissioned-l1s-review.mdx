## What are Permissioned L1s?

Permissioned L1s are Layer 1 blockchains where validator participation is controlled by a central authority rather than being open to anyone. Unlike permissionless networks where anyone can become a validator by staking tokens, permissioned L1s use **Proof of Authority (PoA)** as their sybil protection mechanism.

## Proof of Authority (PoA)

**Proof of Authority** is a sybil protection mechanism that centralizes control over who can validate the network to one account (EoA or multi-sig). Instead of requiring validators to stake tokens (like Proof of Stake), PoA leverages real-world identity and reputation.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Known Entities**: Validators are operated by trusted organizations
- **Reputation-Based**: Validators risk damaging real-world reputation if they misbehave
- **Weight-Based Influence**: Validators can have different voting weights
- **No Economic Incentives**: Validators don't receive rewards or face on-chain penalties

### When to Use PoA:
- Known participants that can be identified and vetted
- Existing trust relationships or legal frameworks
- Regulatory compliance requiring known validator identities
- Private networks for specific consortia
- High throughput requirements over decentralization

## Validator Manager Contract

The **Validator Manager Contract** is the smart contract system that manages validator operations in permissioned L1s. It follows a two-phase commit pattern for all validator changes.

### Core Functions:

**Initialization:**
- `initializeValidatorSet()`: Establishes initial validator set when converting Subnet to L1

**Validator Lifecycle Management:**
- `initiateValidatorRegistration()`: Starts adding a new validator
- `completeValidatorRegistration()`: Finalizes validator addition after Platform-Chain confirmation
- `initiateValidatorRemoval()`: Begins removing a validator
- `completeValidatorRemoval()`: Finalizes removal after Platform-Chain confirmation
- `initiateValidatorWeightUpdate()`: Changes validator voting weight
- `completeValidatorWeightUpdate()`: Finalizes weight changes

### Key Features:
- All functions protected with `onlyOwner` modifier
- Two-phase commit pattern: initiate → complete
- Churn rate limiting to prevent rapid validator set changes
- Warp message construction and verification

## Platform-Chain Integration

The **Platform Chain (Platform-Chain)** is the backbone for Lux's native interoperability. It serves as a registry of all validators in the network, including L1 validators.

### How Platform-Chain Calls Work:

1. **Validator Registration**: When adding a validator, the contract initiates a Platform-Chain transaction
2. **Warp Messages**: Cross-chain communication uses Warp messages to interact with Platform-Chain
3. **Confirmation Process**: Platform-Chain processes the request and sends confirmation back
4. **State Updates**: The validator manager contract updates its state based on Platform-Chain confirmation

### Platform-Chain Transaction Types:
- `CreateSubnetTx`: Creates new subnet for L1
- `CreateChainTx`: Creates new blockchain within subnet
- Validator registration/removal transactions
- Weight update transactions

### Key Points:
- Platform-Chain is **not EVM-based** - requires compatible wallet like Core wallet
- L1 validators sync Platform-Chain but don't participate in its consensus
- All validator changes must be confirmed by Platform-Chain before taking effect
- Platform-Chain maintains the authoritative record of all validators across the network
