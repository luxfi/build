The Proof of Stake algorithm covered in the previous section is available for your own L1 if you decide to build a permissionless blockchain. One of the key design decisions you'll need to make is choosing which token will serve as your staking token.

## Separating Staking and Native Tokens

In many networks, such as Ethereum, the same token is used for both staking and paying for gas. However, **Lux L1s offer the flexibility to separate staking tokens from native (gas) tokens**, as they fulfill fundamentally different purposes:

- **Native Token (Gas Token)**: Used to pay for transaction fees and execute smart contracts on your L1
- **Staking Token**: Used to secure the network through the Proof of Stake mechanism

### Why Use the Same Token?

Using your native token as the staking token creates a unified economic model where:
- Validators have a direct stake in the L1's success
- Token utility is maximized (both for transactions and security)
- The economic security is directly tied to your L1's value

### Why Use a Different Token?

Alternatively, you might choose to use a separate staking token (such as LUX or another established token) when:
- You want to bootstrap security from an existing liquid token
- Your native token is designed for specific use cases that don't align with staking economics
- You want to leverage an established validator set from another network

## Critical Design Consideration: Token Liquidity

If you decide to use an alternative token (rather than your native token) as your staking token, **you must choose a token with substantial liquidity and market depth**. This is a critical security consideration.

### The Liquidity Attack Vector

Using a low-liquidity token as your staking token exposes your L1 to a potentially devastating attack:

1. **Attack Scenario**: A malicious actor could take out a large loan or use existing capital to purchase a majority of the staking token
2. **Network Takeover**: With >51% of the staking token, they gain control of your network's consensus
3. **Exploitation**: They could halt the network, double-spend, censor transactions, or otherwise disrupt operations
4. **Exit**: After causing damage or extracting value, they could sell back the staking tokens (potentially at a profit if they shorted your native token)

### Liquidity Requirements

When selecting an alternative staking token, evaluate:
- **Market Capitalization**: Is it large enough that acquiring 51% would be prohibitively expensive?
- **Daily Trading Volume**: Can large amounts be bought without significantly moving the price?
- **Market Depth**: Are there sufficient orders on both sides of the order book?
- **Distribution**: Is the token widely distributed, or controlled by a few large holders?
