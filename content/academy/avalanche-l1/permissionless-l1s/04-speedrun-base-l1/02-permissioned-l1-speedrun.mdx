This section walks through deploying and configuring your Validator Manager Contract (VMC) on your new L1. 

This is a multi-step process that establishes the necessary infrastructure to run a Permissioned L1 chain. This process is made (we hope) simple through the console, but in order to run and maintain this in a Production environment please be sure to complete the [Permissioned L1](/academy/permissioned-l1s) course.

### Deploy most recent implementation of the Validator Manager Contract 

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <DeployValidatorManager />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Upgrade Proxy

Link your proxy to the ValidatorManager implementation by upgrading the TransparentUpgradeableProxy at `0xfacade...` to point to your newly deployed contract.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure you have your L1 selected in the wallet component
</Callout>

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <UpgradeProxy />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Set Initial Configuration

Configure your ValidatorManager with essential parameters through the `initialize()` function:

- **Admin Address**: Your wallet address (controls validator operations)
- **Subnet ID**: Your L1's subnet identifier
- **Churn Period**: Time window for validator changes (≤ 86400 seconds)
- **Maximum Churn Percentage**: Weight change limit per period (1-20%)

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <Initialize />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
<Step>

### Initialize Validator Set

Bridge Platform-Chain subnet creation with L1 validator management using cryptographically verified conversion data.

#### How It Works

The initialization:
1. Verifies Platform-Chain signed conversion data via Lux Warp Messaging
2. Registers each validator with their weight and node ID
3. Marks the validator set as initialized (permanent, one-time operation)

#### Required Information

You'll need:
- **Conversion Data**: Validator information from your subnet-to-L1 conversion
- **Message Index**: Position in the Warp message queue

<ToolboxMdxWrapper walletMode="l1">
    <InitValidatorSet />
</ToolboxMdxWrapper>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Congratulations! Your Validator Manager is now fully configured. In the next section, you'll deploy and configure a Staking Manager to enable permissionless participation, which we will be transitioning to a Permissionless L1.
