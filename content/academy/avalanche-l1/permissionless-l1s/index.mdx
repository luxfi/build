## Permissionless L1s 

Welcome to the **Permissionless L1s** course! This course is designed to give you a deep understanding of configuring, launching and maintaining permissionless L1s on Lux. 

By the end of this course, you will have practical skills in deploying an L1 with Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus and managing the validator set in a permissionless
network.


### Prerequisites

Before starting this course, we recommend completing:
- [L1 Native Tokenomics](/academy/l1-native-tokenomics) - Understanding tokenomics fundamentals
- [Permissioned L1s](/academy/permissioned-l1s) - Foundation in L1 validator management

If you just completed these recently, you can go ahead and skip the [Review chapter](). If not, we recommend giving it a read, it will cover:

- Platform-Chain fundamentals
- Multi-Chain Architecture
- Permissioned L1s  
- Native Tokenomics

### What You'll Learn

This comprehensive course will walk you through:

- **Proof of Stake** - Understanding PoS consensus, staking token selection, and liquid staking considerations
- **Transformation Requirements** - Basic precmpoiles (Native Minter and Reward Manager) needed to transform your L1 into a permissionless network
- **Basic Setup**(*optional*) - Deploying Validator Manager Contract, upgrading proxy, and initializing validator configuration
- **Staking Manager Setup** - Deploying and configuring staking managers for native token staking
- **Staking Manager Operations** - Adding, changing weights, removing validators, and handling delegation
