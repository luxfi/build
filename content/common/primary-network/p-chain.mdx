In the Lux Network, the Platform-Chain of the Primary Network is responsible for all validator and Lux L1-level operations. The Platform-Chain supports the creation of new blockchains and Lux L1s, the addition of validators to Lux L1s, staking operations, and other platform-level operations.

Each Lux validator can register a BLS public key alongside its NodeID on the Lux Platform-Chain. Validators of Lux L1s can stake different amounts of the Lux L1's staking token. Through the Platform-Chain, we can determine a weighted set of BLS Public Keys that correspond to the validators of each Lux L1 on the Lux Network.

Anyone can see on the Platform-Chain the current weighted validator sets of every Lux L1 and how the set has evolved over time.
