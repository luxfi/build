## Get Free Testnet Tokens

With a Lux Build account and connected wallet, you'll **automatically receive testnet tokens** on LUExchange-Chain, Platform-Chain, Dispatch, Echo, and other supported L1s. No coupon codes needed!

**How it works:**
1. Create a Lux Build account (if you haven't already)
2. Connect your Core wallet
3. Tokens are automatically sent to your wallet when needed

### Alternative Faucet

If you prefer not to create a [Lux Build account](https://build.lux.network/login), you can also use the external [Lux Testnet Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?token=c) with coupon code: **lux-academy**

If you experience any issues claiming testnet tokens, please reach out in the <a href="https://t.me/luxacademy" target='_blank'>Lux Academy Telegram Chat</a>, so our Developer Relations team can assist you.
