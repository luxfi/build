The Lux Starter Kit contains everything you need to get started quickly with Lux. Among other tools it contains Lux CLI. With that you can set up a local network, create a Lux L1, customize the Lux L1/VM configuration, and so on. 

In this course we will run the Lux Starter Kit in a hosted environment on Github. This is the quickest way to get started.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Set Up Lux Starter Kit:

### Create a Codespace
[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=769886086&machine=standardLinux32gb)

The Codespace will open in a new tab. You must be logged into a GitHub account, otherwise codespaces will not be available. Wait a few minutes until it's fully built. Alternatively, you can also clone the repo:

<Link
    href="https://github.com/luxfi/lux-starter-kit"
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
    target='_blank'
>Open Lux Starter Kit</Link>

</Step>
<Step>

### Verify everything is working correctly

Open the terminal with `` Ctrl + ` `` or by opening it through the menu:

![](/common-images/lux-starter-kit/new-terminal.png)

Now enter lux -h to verify everything is working:

```bash
lux -h
```

As a result you should see the help of Lux CLI:

```
Lux-CLI is a command-line tool that gives developers access to
everything Lux. This release specializes in helping developers
build and test Lux L1s.

To get started, look at the documentation for the subcommands or jump right
in with lux blockchain create myNewLux L1.

Usage:
  lux [command]

Available Commands:
  config                Modify configuration for Lux-CLI
  help                  Help about any command
  key                   Create and manage testnet signing keys
```

</Step>

### Optional: Open Codespace locally in Visual Studio Code

You can switch any time from the browser IDE to Visual Studio Code:



The first time you switch, you will be asked to install the [Codespaces extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.codespaces) and connect VS Code to you GitHub account, if it is not already connceted.
