## Networks
We can deploy an Lux L1 to a network of validators. This means we either run these validators on our own or we convince a subset of the existing validators of the Lux network to validate our Lux L1.

These validators validate the Lux L1 according to our rules and will get compensated with transaction fees. A validator can validate as many Lux L1s as they like. However, in practice hardware usually limits it to around 5 Lux L1s per Validator.

Depending on our use case, we can choose a network to deploy on:

### Mainnet

When our Lux L1 goes into production, we want to run it on mainnet. With the introduction of ACP-77, Lux L1 validators no longer must validate the primary network.

### Testnet (Testnet)

When we want to test our Lux L1, we can deploy it to the Testnet Testnet. The easiest way to do this is to run a Testnet Node. On Testnet, it only costs 1 LUX to run a node. That LUX can be obtained for free from the Testnet Faucet we used in the Lux Fundamentals course. All tokens on the Testnet are valueless.

When deploying the Lux L1 to Testnet, anyone can interact with it, so long as at least one validator is online. This is great for more intense testing with multiple parties. Further, the Lux L1 can interact with other Lux L1s deployed in Testnet to test more complex behavior.


### Local Network

For our purposes, it is sufficient to run a small local network of 5 nodes on our machine exclusive to us. This has advantages:

- It is very fast to set up
- We have full control over all tokens of the network and can arbitrarily create testnet tokens for our testing
- We can work offline, if needed

By selecting “Local Network” during your deployment earlier, you have deployed your first Lux L1 on the local network.
