title: On Lux Mainnet
description: Deploy an Lux L1 to Lux Mainnet
---
<Callout type="warn">
Deploying an Lux L1 to Mainnet has many risks. Doing so safely requires a laser focus on security. This tutorial does its best to point out common pitfalls, but there may be other risks not discussed here.

This tutorial is an educational resource and provides no guarantees that following it results in a secure deployment. Additionally, this tutorial takes some shortcuts that aid the understanding of the deployment process at the expense of security. The text highlights these shortcuts and they shouldn't be used for a production deployment.
</Callout>

After managing a successful Lux L1 deployment on the `Testnet Testnet`, you're ready to deploy your Lux L1 on Mainnet. If you haven't done so, first [Deploy an Lux L1 on Testnet](/docs/tooling/lux-cli/create-deploy-lux-l1s/deploy-on-testnet-testnet).

This tutorial shows how to do the following on `Mainnet`.

- Deploy an Lux L1.
- Add a node as a validator to the Lux L1.

<Callout title="Note">
All IDs in this article are for illustration purposes only. They are guaranteed to be different in your own run-through of this tutorial.
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- An Lux node running and [fully bootstrapped](/docs/nodes) on `Mainnet`
- [Lux-CLI is installed](/docs/tooling/lux-cli) on each validator node's box
- A [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) device
- You've [created an Lux L1 configuration](/docs/tooling/lux-cli#create-your-lux-l1-configuration) and fully tested a [Testnet Testnet Lux L1 deployment](/docs/tooling/lux-cli/create-deploy-lux-l1s/deploy-on-testnet-testnet)

### Setting up Your Ledger[​](#setting-up-your-ledger "Direct link to heading")

In the interest of security, all Lux-CLI `Mainnet` operations require the use of a connected Ledger device. You must unlock your Ledger and run the Lux App. See [How to Use Ledger](https://support.lux.network/en/articles/6150237-how-to-use-a-ledger-nano-s-or-nano-x-with-lux) for help getting set up.

Ledger devices support TX signing for any address inside a sequence automatically generated by the device.

By default, Lux-CLI uses the first address of the derivation, and that address needs funds to issue the TXs to create the Lux L1 and add validators.

To get the first `Mainnet` address of your Ledger device, first make sure it is connected, unblocked, and running the Lux app. Then execute the `key list` command:

```bash
lux key list --ledger 0 --mainnet
```

```bash
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
|  KIND  |  NAME   |          CHAIN          |                    ADDRESS                    | BALANCE | NETWORK |
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
| ledger | index 0 | Platform-Chain (Bech32 format) | P-lux1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j |      11 | Mainnet |
+--------+---------+-------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+---------+---------+
```

The command prints the Platform-Chain address for `Mainnet`, `P-lux1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j`, and its balance.

<Callout title="Note">
You can use the `key list` command to get any Ledger address in the derivation sequence by changing the index parameter from `0` to the one desired, or to a list of them (for example: `2`, or `0,4,7`). Also, you can ask for addresses on `Mainnet` with the `--mainnet` parameter, and local networks with the `--local` parameter.
</Callout>

#### Funding the Ledger[​](#funding-the-ledger "Direct link to heading")

A new Ledger device has no funds on the addresses it controls. You'll need to send funds to it by exporting them from LUExchange-Chain to the Platform-Chain using [Core web](https://core.app/) connected to [Core extension](https://core.app/).

You can load the Ledger's LUExchange-Chain address in Core extension, or load in a different private key to [Core extension](https://core.app/), and then connect to Core web .

You can move test funds from the LUExchange-Chain to the Platform-Chain by clicking Stake on Core web , then Cross-Chain Transfer (find more details on [this tutorial](https://support.lux.network/en/articles/8133713-core-web-how-do-i-make-cross-chain-transfers-in-core-stake)).

Deploy the Lux L1[​](#deploy-the-lux-l1 "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------

<Callout title="Note">
To deploy the Lux L1, you will need some LUX on the Platform-Chain.
</Callout>

For our Testnet example, we used our local machine as a bootstrap validator. However, since bootstrapping a node to Mainnet will take several hours,
we will use an Lux node set up on an AWS server that is already bootstrapped to Mainnet for this example.

To check if the Lux node is done bootstrapping, ssh into the node and call [`info.isBootstrapped`](/docs/rpcs/other/info-rpc#infoisbootstrapped) by copying and pasting the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"P"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

If this returns `true`, it means that the chain is bootstrapped and we will proceed to deploying our L1.

We will need to have the Lux node's NodeID, BLS public key and proof of possession. These can be obtained by ssh into the node itself and run the `getNodeID` API specified [here](/docs/rpcs/other/info-rpc#infogetnodeid)

To deploy the new Lux L1, with your Ledger unlocked and running the Lux app, run:

```bash
lux blockchain deploy testblockchain
```

This is going to start a new prompt series.

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to deploy on:
    Local Network
    Testnet
  ▸ Mainnet
```

This tutorial is about deploying to `Mainnet`, so navigate with the arrow keys to `Mainnet` and hit enter. The user is then asked to provide which private key to use for the deployment. Select a key to has Platform-Chain LUX to pay for transaction fees.

```bash
✔ Mainnet
Deploying [testblockchain] to Mainnet
```

After that, CLI shows the `Mainnet` Ledger address used to fund the deployment:

```bash
Ledger address: P-lux1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j
```

Select `No` to using local machine as a bootstrap validator on the blockchain.

```bash
You can use your local machine as a bootstrap validator on the blockchain
This means that you don't have to to set up a remote server on a cloud service (e.g. AWS / GCP) to be a validator on the blockchain.
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Do you want to use your local machine as a bootstrap validator?:
    Yes
  ▸ No
```

Enter 1 as the number of bootstrap validators we will be setting up.

```bash
✔ No
✗ How many bootstrap validators do you want to set up?: 1
```

Select `Yes` since we have already set up our Lux Node on AWS.

```bash
If you have set up your own Lux Nodes, you can provide the Node ID and BLS Key from those nodes in the next step.
Otherwise, we will generate new Node IDs and BLS Key for you.
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Have you set up your own Lux Nodes?:
  ▸ Yes
    No
```

Next, we will enter the node's Node-ID:

```bash
Getting info for bootstrap validator 1
✗ What is the NodeID of the node you want to add as bootstrap validator?: █
```

And BLS public key and proof of possession:

```bash
Next, we need the public key and proof of possession of the node's BLS
Check https://build.lux.network/docs/rpcs/other/info-rpc#infogetnodeid for instructions on calling info.getNodeID API
✗ What is the node's BLS public key?: █
```

Next, the CLI generates a CreateSubnet TX to create the Subnet and asks the user to sign it by using the Ledger.

```bash
*** Please sign Lux L1 creation hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

If the Ledger doesn't have enough funds, the user may see an error message:

```bash
*** Please sign Lux L1 creation hash on the ledger device ***
Error: insufficient funds: provided UTXOs need 1000000000 more units of asset "U8iRqJoiJm8xZHAacmvYyZVwqQx6uDNtQeP3CQ6fcgQk3JqnK"
```

If successful, the CLI next asks you to sign a CreateChain Tx. Once CreateChain Tx is signed, it will then ask you to sign ConvertSubnetToL1 Tx.

Well done. You have just created your own Lux L1 on `Mainnet`.

You will be able to see information on the deployed L1 at the end of `lux blockchain deploy` command:

```bash
+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
| DEPLOYMENT RESULTS |                                                    |

+--------------------+----------------------------------------------------+
```

To get your new Lux L1 information, there are two options:

- Call `lux blockchain describe` command or
- Visit the [Lux L1 Explorer](https://subnets-test.lux.network/). The search best works by blockchain ID, so in this example, enter `2U7vNdB78xTiN6QtZ9aetfKoGtQhfeEPQG6QZC8bpq8QMf4cDx` into the search box and you should see your shiny new blockchain information.

Add a Validator[​](#add-a-validator "Direct link to heading")
-------------------------------------------------------------

Before proceeding to add a validator to our Lux L1, we will need to have the validator's NodeID, BLS public key and proof of possession. These can be obtained by ssh into the node itself and run the `getNodeID` API specified [here](/docs/rpcs/other/info-rpc#infogetnodeid)

To add a validator to an Lux L1, the owner of the key that acts as the controller of ValidatorManager contract specified in `lux blockchain create` command above run:

```bash
lux blockchain addValidator testblockchain
```

Choose `Mainnet`:

```bash
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Choose a network to deploy on:
  ▸ Mainnet
```

The CLI will show the Ledger address that will be used to pay for add validator tx:

```bash
Ledger address: P-lux1ucykh6ls8thqpuwhg3vp8vvu6spg5e8tp8a25j
```

Now enter the **NodeID** of the new validator to be added.

```bash
What is the NodeID of the validator you'd like to whitelist?: NodeID-BFa1paAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQGjPhUy
```

Next, enter the node's BLS public key and proof of possession.

Now, enter the amount of LUX that you would like to allocate to the new validator.

The validator's balance is used to pay for continuous fee to the Platform-Chain. When this Balance reaches 0, the validator will be considered inactive and will no longer participate in validating the L1.

1 LUX should last the validator about a month.

```bash
What balance would you like to assign to the validator (in LUX)?: 1
```

Sign the addValidatorTx with your Ledger:

```bash
*** Please sign add validator hash on the ledger device ***
```

This activates a `Please review` window on the Ledger. Navigate to the Ledger's `APPROVE` window by using the Ledger's right button, and then authorize the request by pressing both left and right buttons.

This might take a couple of seconds. After, it prints:

```bash
Transaction successful, transaction ID: r3tJ4Wr2CWA8AaticmFrKdKgAs5AhW2wwWTaQHRBZKwJhsXzb
```

This means the node is now a validator on the given Lux L1 on `Mainnet`!

Going Live[​](#going-live "Direct link to heading")
---------------------------------------------------

For the safety of your validators, you should setup dedicated API nodes to process transactions, but for test purposes, you can issue transactions directly to one of your validator's RPC interface.
