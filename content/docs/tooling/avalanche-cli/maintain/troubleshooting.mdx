Deployment Times Out[​](#deployment-times-out "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

During a local deployment, your network may fail to start. Your error may look something like this:

```bash
[~]$ lux blockchain deploy myblockchain

✔ Local Network
Deploying [myblockchain] to Local Network
Backend controller started, pid: 26388, output at: /Users/user/.lux-cli/runs/server_20221231_111605/lux-cli-backend
VMs ready.
Starting network...
..................................................................................
..................................................................................
......Error: failed to query network health: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded
```

Lux-CLI only supports running one local Lux network at a time. If other instances of LuxGo are running concurrently, your Lux-CLI network fails to start.

To test for this error, start by shutting down any Lux nodes started by Lux-CLI.

```bash
lux network clean --hard
```

Next, look for any lingering LuxGo processes with:

```bash
ps aux | grep luxgo
```

If any processes are running, you need to stop them before you can launch your VM with Lux-CLI.

<Callout type="warn">
If you're running a validator node on the same box you're using Lux-CLI, **don't** end any of these lingering LuxGo processes. This may shut down your validator and could affect your validation uptime.
</Callout>


Incompatible RPC Version for Custom VM[​](#incompatible-rpc-version-for-custom-vm "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're locally deploying a custom VM, you may run into this error message.

```bash
[~]$ lux blockchain deploy myblockchain

✔ Local Network
Deploying [myblockchain] to Local Network
Backend controller started, pid: 26388, output at: /Users/user/.lux-cli/runs/server_20221231_111605/lux-cli-backend
VMs ready.
Starting network...
.........
Blockchain has been deployed. Wait until network acknowledges...
..................................................................................
..................................................................................
......Error: failed to query network health: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded
```

This error has many possible causes, but a common cause is usually due to **an RPC protocol version mismatch.**

LuxGo communicates with custom VMs over RPC using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). gRPC defines a protocol specification shared by both LuxGo and the VM. **Both components must be running the same RPC version for VM deployment to work.**

Your custom VM's RPC version is set by the version of LuxGo that you import. By default, Lux-CLI creates local Avalalanche networks that run the latest LuxGo release.

### Example[​](#example "Direct link to heading")

Here's an example with real numbers from the LuxGo compatibility page:

- If the latest LuxGo release is version v1.10.11, then Lux-CLI deploys a network with RPC version 28.
- For your deploy to be successful, your VM must also have RPC version 28. Because only LuxGo versions v1.10.9, v1.10.10 and v1.10.11 supports RPC version 28, your VM **must** import one of those versions.

### Solution[​](#solution "Direct link to heading")

Error: `RPCChainVM protocol version mismatch between LuxGo and Virtual Machine plugin`

This error occurs when the RPCChainVM protocol version used by VMs like Subnet-EVM are incompatible with the protocol version of LuxGo.

If your VM has an RPC version mismatch, you have two options:

1.  Update the version of LuxGo you use in your VM. This is the correct long-term approach.
2.  Use Lux-CLI to deploy an older version of LuxGo by using the `--luxgo-version` flag. Both the [`blockchain deploy`](/docs/tooling/cli-commands#deploy) and [`network start`](/docs/tooling/cli-commands#start) commands support setting the LuxGo version explicitly.

Although it's very important to keep your version of LuxGo up-to-date, this workaround helps you avoid broken builds in the short term.

<Callout type="warn">
You must upgrade to the latest LuxGo version when deploying publicly to Testnet Testnet or Lux Mainnet.
</Callout>


### More Information[​](#more-information "Direct link to heading")

Similar version matching is required in different tools on the ecosystem. Here is a compatibility table showing which RPCChainVM Version implements the more recent releases of LuxGo, Subnet-EVM, Precompile-EVM and HyperSDK.

Updates to LuxGo's RPC version are **not** tied to its semantic version scheme. Minor LuxGo version bumps may include a breaking RPC version bump.

Fix for MacBook Air M1/M2: ‘Bad CPU type in executable' Error[​](#fix-for-macbook-air-m1m2-bad-cpu-type-in-executable-error "Direct link to heading")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When running `lux blockchain deploy` via the Lux-CLI, the terminal may throw an error that contains the following:

```bash
zsh: bad CPU type in executable:
/Users/user.name/Downloads/build/luxgo
```

This is because some Macs lack support for x86 binaries. Running the following command should fix this issue:

```bash
/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta
```
