The Lux-CLI is a powerful command-line tool that streamlines the process of building, deploying, and managing Lux L1 blockchains (formerly known as Subnets).

## Key Features

- **Create & Deploy L1s**: Quickly create and deploy new Lux L1 blockchains to local, testnet, or mainnet environments
- **VM Management**: Deploy L1s with Subnet-EVM or custom Virtual Machines
- **Node Operations**: Run and manage validator nodes across different cloud providers
- **Cross-Chain Messaging**: Set up Teleporter for cross-chain communication
- **Transaction Management**: Handle native token transfers and Platform-Chain operations
