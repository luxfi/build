description: Create and manage temporary Lux networks for local development and testing
---

tmpnet creates temporary Lux networks on your local machine. You get a complete multi-node network with consensus, P2P communication, and pre-funded test keys—everything you need to test custom VMs, L1s, and applications before deploying to testnet or mainnet.

Networks run as native processes (no Docker needed). All configuration lives on disk at `~/.tmpnet/networks/`, making it easy to inspect state, share configs, or debug issues.

## What You Get

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Multi-node networks** | Spin up 2-50 validator nodes in under a minute |
| **Pre-funded keys** | 50 keys with LUX balances on P, X, and LUExchange-Chain |
| **Custom VMs** | Deploy and test your Virtual Machines |
| **Subnets** | Create subnets with specific validator sets |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus metrics and Promtail logs out of the box |
| **CLI + Go API** | Use `tmpnetctl` commands or Go code |

## Use Cases

| Scenario | What You Can Test |
|----------|-------------------|
| **L1 Development** | Run your L1 with multiple validators locally before deploying to Testnet |
| **Custom VMs** | Test VM behavior with real consensus across multiple nodes |
| **Staking Operations** | Add validators, test delegation, verify rewards distribution |
| **Subnet Testing** | Create subnets, manage validators, test cross-subnet messaging |
| **Integration Tests** | Write automated Go tests that spin up networks on demand |

## Basic Workflow

```bash
# Start a 5-node network
tmpnetctl start-network --luxgo-path=./bin/luxgo

# Network is running at ~/.tmpnet/networks/latest
# Get node URIs
cat ~/.tmpnet/networks/latest/NodeID-*/process.json | jq -r '.uri'

# Get pre-funded keys
cat ~/.tmpnet/networks/latest/config.json | jq -r '.preFundedKeys[0]'

# Stop when done
tmpnetctl stop-network
```

## Network Directory Structure

Each network you create gets its own directory at `~/.tmpnet/networks/[timestamp]/`:

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `config.json` | Network settings, pre-funded keys |
| `genesis.json` | Genesis configuration |
| `NodeID-*/` | Per-node directories (logs, database, config) |
| `NodeID-*/process.json` | Running node info (PID, URI, ports) |
| `metrics.txt` | Grafana dashboard link |

The `latest` symlink always points to your most recent network.

Both `tmpnetctl` and your Go code can manage the same networks because everything is file-based. No daemon, no Docker, no magic.
