### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name     | Type   | Scheme  |
| -------- | ------ | ------- |
| `apiKey` | apiKey | API key |

The ChainKit SDK can be used without an API key, but rate limits will be lower. Adding an API key allows for higher rate limits. To get an API key, create one via [Builder Console](/console/utilities/data-api-keys) and securely store it. Whether or not you use an API key, you can still interact with the SDK effectively, but the API key provides performance benefits for higher request volumes.

```javascript
import { Lux } from "@lux-sdk/chainkit";

const luxSDK = new Lux({
  apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
  chainId: "43114",
  network: "mainnet",
});

async function run() {
  const result = await luxSDK.metrics.healthCheck();

  // Handle the result
  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Never hardcode your API key directly into your code. Instead, securely store
  it and retrieve it from an environment variable, a secrets manager, or a
  dedicated configuration storage mechanism. This ensures that sensitive
  information remains protected and is not exposed in version control or
  publicly accessible code.
