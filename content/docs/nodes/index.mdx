description: A brief introduction to the concepts of nodes and validators within the Lux ecosystem.
---

LuxGo nodes relay transactions/blocks, expose APIs, and (when staked) participate in consensus on the Primary Network and any Lux L1s they validate.

## Node Roles

| Role | Purpose | Consensus Participation |
|------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Validator** | Stakes on the Platform-Chain, validates the Primary Network and any Subnets/L1s it joins | Yes (polled for Snowman/Snowman++) |
| **Non-validating** | Tracks chains, serves APIs, used for infra and indexing | No (not polled) |

All nodes: connect via P2P with staking certs, track P/C/X, bootstrap or state-sync chains, and serve APIs if enabled.

## Data Retention Modes

| Mode | Description | When to use |
|------|-------------|------------|
| **Archive** | Keep full history | Auditing, full re-exec |
| **Pruned** | Drop old data after sync | Save disk on long-running nodes |
| **State sync** | Sync from state summaries instead of full replay | Fast catch-up for new nodes |

Choose per-chain via chain configs.

## Validator Requirements

| Network | Requirements |
|---------|--------------|
| **Primary Network** | Stake **2,000 LUX** on the Platform-Chain; validation period **14–365 days**; meet uptime to earn rewards; must validate Platform-Chain, LUExchange-Chain, Exchange-Chain |
| **Lux L1s** | Validators pay **1.33 LUX/month** (burned) to the Platform-Chain for validation slots; each L1 sets its own validation/staking rules beyond that. |

<Callout type="info">
Lux L1s are blockchains that run on a Subnet. When you validate a Subnet, you validate all Lux L1s on that Subnet.
</Callout>

### Validator Responsibilities

- **Validate & build blocks**: Participate in Snowman++ consensus (all Primary Network chains and most L1s).
- **Maintain APIs**: Serve RPCs for wallets/apps if enabled.
- **Stay healthy**: Meet uptime and networking requirements to remain in good standing and earn rewards.
