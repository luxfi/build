This article describes how to run a node that tracks an Lux L1. It requires building LuxGo, adding Virtual Machine binaries as plugins to your local data directory, and running LuxGo to track these binaries.

This tutorial specifically covers tracking an Lux L1 built with Lux's [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm), the default [Virtual Machine](/docs/primary-network/virtual-machines) run by Lux L1s on Lux.

## Build LuxGo

It is recommended that you must complete [this comprehensive guide](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/from-source) which demonstrates how to build and run a basic Lux node from source.

## Build Lux L1 Binaries

After building LuxGo successfully,

<Steps>
<Step>
Clone [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm):

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/luxfi
git clone https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm.git
```
</Step>

<Step>
In the Subnet-EVM directory, run the build script, and save it in the `plugins` folder of your `.luxgo` data directory. Name the plugin after the `VMID` of the Lux L1 you wish to track. The `VMID` of the WAGMI Lux L1 is the value beginning with **srEX...**

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm
./scripts/build.sh ~/.luxgo/plugins/srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Where can I find Lux L1 parameters like VMID?">
VMID, Lux L1 ID (SubnetID), ChainID, and all other parameters can be found in the "Chain Info" section of the Lux L1 Explorer.

- [Lux Mainnet](https://subnets.lux.network/c-chain)
- [Testnet Testnet](https://subnets-test.lux.network/c-chain)
</Accordion>
</Accordions>
</Step>

<Step>
Create a file named `config.json` and add a `track-subnets` field that is populated with the `SubnetID` you wish to track. The `SubnetID` of the WAGMI Lux L1 is the value beginning with **28nr...**

```bash
cd ~/.luxgo
echo '{"track-subnets": "28nrH5T2BMvNrWecFcV3mfccjs6axM1TVyqe79MCv2Mhs8kxiY"}' > config.json
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Run the Node

Run LuxGo with the `—config-file` flag to start your node and ensure it tracks the Lux L1s included in the configuration file.

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/luxfi/luxgo
./build/luxgo --config-file ~/.luxgo/config.json --network-id=testnet
```

<Callout title="Note">
Note: The above command includes the `--network-id=testnet` command because the WAGMI Lux L1 is deployed on Testnet Testnet.
</Callout>

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Run L1 Node Without The Config File">
If you would prefer to track Lux L1s using a command line flag, you can instead use the `--track-subnets` flag. For example:

```bash
./build/luxgo --track-subnets 28nrH5T2BMvNrWecFcV3mfccjs6axM1TVyqe79MCv2Mhs8kxiY --network-id=testnet
```
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

You should now see terminal filled with logs and information to suggest the node is properly running and has began bootstrapping to the network.

## Bootstrapping and RPC Details

It may take a few hours for the node to fully [bootstrap](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/from-source#bootstrapping) to the Lux Primary Network and tracked Lux L1s.

When finished bootstrapping, the endpoint will be:

```bash
localhost:9650/ext/bc/<BlockchainID>/rpc
```

if run locally, or:

```bash
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/<BlockchainID>/rpc
```

if run on a cloud provider. The “X”s should be replaced with the public IP of your EC2 instance.

For more information on the requests available at these endpoints, please see the [Subnet-EVM API Reference](/docs/rpcs/subnet-evm) documentation.

Because each node is also tracking the Primary Network, those [RPC endpoints](/docs/nodes/run-a-node/from-source#rpc) are available as well.
