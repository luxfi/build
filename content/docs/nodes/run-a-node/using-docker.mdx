For an easier way to set up and run a node, try the [Lux Console Node Setup Tool](/console/primary-network/node-setup).
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, you must ensure that:
- Docker is installed on your system
- You need to clone the [LuxGo repository](https://github.com/luxfi/luxgo)
- You need to install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- Docker daemon is running on your machine

You can verify your Docker installation by running:
```bash
docker --version
```

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image for the latest `luxgo` branch:

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Execute the build script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_image.sh
   ```

This script will create a Docker image containing the latest version of LuxGo.

## Verifying the Build

After the build completes, verify the image was created successfully:

```bash
docker image ls
```

You should see an image with:
- Repository: `avaplatform/luxgo`
- Tag: `xxxxxxxx` (where `xxxxxxxx` is the shortened commit hash of the source code used for the build)

## Running LuxGo Node

To start an LuxGo node, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -ti -p 9650:9650 -p 9651:9651 avaplatform/luxgo:xxxxxxxx /luxgo/build/luxgo
```

This command:
- Creates an interactive container (`-ti`)
- Maps the following ports:
  - `9650`: HTTP API port
  - `9651`: P2P networking port
- Uses the built LuxGo image
- Executes the LuxGo binary inside the container

## Port Configuration

The default ports used by LuxGo are:
- `9650`: HTTP API
- `9651`: P2P networking

Ensure these ports are available on your host machine and not blocked by firewalls.
