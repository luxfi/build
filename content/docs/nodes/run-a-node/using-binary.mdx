description: Learn how to run an Lux node from a pre-built binary program.

## Download Binary

To download a pre-built binary instead of building from source code, go to the official [LuxGo releases page](https://github.com/luxfi/luxgo/releases), and select the desired version.

Scroll down to the **Assets** section, and select the appropriate file. You can follow below rules to find out the right binary.

### For MacOS

Download the `luxgo-macos-<VERSION>.zip` file and unzip using the below command:

```bash
unzip luxgo-macos-<VERSION>.zip
```

The resulting folder, `luxgo-<VERSION>`, contains the binaries.

### Linux (PCs or Cloud Providers)

Download the `luxgo-linux-amd64-<VERSION>.tar.gz` file and unzip using the below command:

```bash
tar -xvf luxgo-linux-amd64-<VERSION>.tar.gz
```

The resulting folder, `luxgo-<VERSION>-linux`, contains the binaries.

### Linux (Arm64)

Download the `luxgo-linux-arm64-<VERSION>.tar.gz` file and unzip using the below command:

```bash
tar -xvf luxgo-linux-arm64-<VERSION>.tar.gz
```

The resulting folder, `luxgo-<VERSION>-linux`, contains the binaries.

## Start the Node

<Callout title="Note">
To be able to make API calls to your node from other machines, include the argument `--http-host=` when starting the node.
</Callout>

### MacOS

For running a node on the Lux Mainnet:

```bash
./luxgo-<VERSION>/build/luxgo
```

For running a node on the Testnet Testnet:

```bash
./luxgo-<VERSION>/build/luxgo --network-id=testnet
```

### Linux

For running a node on the Lux Mainnet:

```bash
./luxgo-<VERSION>-linux/luxgo
```

For running a node on the Testnet Testnet:

```bash
./luxgo-<VERSION>-linux/luxgo --network-id=testnet
```

## Bootstrapping

A new node needs to catch up to the latest network state before it can participate in consensus and serve API calls. This process (called bootstrapping) currently takes several days for a new node connected to Mainnet, and a day or so for a new node connected to Testnet Testnet. When a given chain is done bootstrapping, it will print logs like this:

```bash
[09-09|17:01:45.295] INFO <C Chain> snowman/transitive.go:392 consensus starting {"lastAcceptedBlock": "2qaFwDJtmCCbMKP4jRpJwH8EFws82Q2yC1HhWgAiy3tGrpGFeb"}
[09-09|17:01:46.199] INFO <P Chain> snowman/transitive.go:392 consensus starting {"lastAcceptedBlock": "2ofmPJuWZbdroCPEMv6aHGvZ45oa8SBp2reEm9gNxvFjnfSGFP"}
[09-09|17:01:51.628] INFO <X Chain> snowman/transitive.go:334 consensus starting {"lenFrontier": 1}
```

### Check Bootstrapping Progress[​](#check-bootstrapping-progress "Direct link to heading")

To check if a given chain is done bootstrapping, in another terminal window call [`info.isBootstrapped`](/docs/rpcs/other/info-rpc#infoisbootstrapped) by copying and pasting the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :1,
    "method" :"info.isBootstrapped",
    "params": {
        "chain":"X"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/info
```

If this returns `true`, the chain is bootstrapped; otherwise, it returns `false`. If you make other API calls to a chain that is not done bootstrapping, it will return `API call rejected because chain is not done bootstrapping`. If you are still experiencing issues please contact us on [Discord.](https://chat.avalabs.org/)

<Callout title="Note">
The 3 chains will bootstrap in the following order: P-chain, X-chain, C-chain.
</Callout>

Learn more about bootstrapping [here](/docs/nodes/maintain/bootstrapping).

## RPC

When finished bootstrapping, the X, P, and LUExchange-Chain RPC endpoints will be:

```bash
localhost:9650/ext/bc/P
localhost:9650/ext/bc/X
localhost:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

if run locally, or

```bash
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/P
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/X
XXX.XX.XX.XXX:9650/ext/bc/C/rpc
```

if run on a cloud provider. The “XXX.XX.XX.XXX" should be replaced with the public IP of your EC2 instance.

For more information on the requests available at these endpoints, please see the [LuxGo API Reference](/docs/rpcs/p-chain) documentation.

## Going Further

Your Lux node will perform consensus on its own, but it is not yet a validator on the network. This means that the rest of the network will not query your node when sampling the network during consensus. If you want to add your node as a validator, check out [Add a Validator](/docs/primary-network/validate/node-validator) to take it a step further.

Also check out the [Maintain](/docs/nodes/maintain/bootstrapping) section to learn about how to maintain and customize your node to fit your needs.
