title: AllowList Interface
description: The AllowList interface is used by many default precompiles to permission access to the features they provide.
---

## Overview

The AllowList is a security feature used by precompiles to manage which addresses have permission to interact with certain contract functionalities. It provides a consistent role-based permission system inherited by all precompiles that use it.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Address** | Inherited by each precompile |
| **ConfigKey** | N/A (Interface only) |

## Role-Based Permissions

The AllowList implements a consistent role-based permission system:

| Role | Value | Description | Permissions |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Admin | 2 | Can manage all roles | Can add/remove any role (Admin, Manager, Enabled) |
| Manager | 3 | Can manage enabled addresses | Can add/remove only Enabled addresses |
| Enabled | 1 | Basic permissions | Can use the precompile's functionality |
| None | 0 | No permissions | Cannot use the precompile or manage permissions |

Each precompile that uses the AllowList interface follows this permission structure, though the specific actions allowed for "Enabled" addresses vary depending on the precompile's purpose. For example:
- In the Contract Deployer AllowList, "Enabled" addresses can deploy contracts
- In the Transaction AllowList, "Enabled" addresses can submit transactions
- In the Native Minter, "Enabled" addresses can mint tokens

## Interface

The AllowList interface is defined as follows:

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface IAllowList {
  event RoleSet(uint256 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender, uint256 oldRole);

  // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the precompile contract.
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to be enabled on the precompile contract.
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have the manager role over the precompile contract.
  function setManager(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have no role for the precompile contract.
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

## Implementation

The AllowList interface is implemented by multiple precompiles in the Subnet-EVM. You can find the core implementation in the [subnet-evm repository](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/allowlist/allowlist.go).

## Precompiles Using AllowList

Several precompiles in Subnet-EVM use the AllowList interface:

- [Deployer AllowList](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/deployer-allowlist)
- [Transaction AllowList](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/transaction-allowlist)
- [Native Minter](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/native-minter)
- [Fee Manager](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/fee-manager)
- [Reward Manager](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/reward-manager)
