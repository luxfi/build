title: Reward Manager
description: Control how transaction fees are distributed or burned on your Lux L1 blockchain.
---

## Overview

The Reward Manager allows you to control how transaction fees are handled in your network. You can:

- Send fees to a specific address (e.g., treasury)
- Allow validators to collect fees
- Burn fees entirely

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Address** | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000004` |
| **ConfigKey** | `rewardManagerConfig` |

## Configuration

You can activate this precompile in your genesis file:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "rewardManagerConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"],
      "initialRewardConfig": {
        // Choose one of:
        "allowFeeRecipients": true,  // Allow validators to collect fees
        "rewardAddress": "0x...",    // Send fees to specific address
        // Empty config = burn fees
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Reward Mechanisms

The Reward Manager supports three mutually exclusive mechanisms:

1. **Validator Fee Collection** (`allowFeeRecipients`)
   - Validators can specify their own fee recipient addresses
   - Fees go to the block producer's chosen address
   - Good for incentivizing network participation

2. **Fixed Reward Address** (`rewardAddress`)
   - All fees go to a single specified address
   - Can be a contract or EOA
   - Useful for treasury or DAO-controlled fee collection

3. **Fee Burning** (default)
   - All transaction fees are burned
   - Reduces total token supply over time
   - Similar to Ethereum's EIP-1559

## Interface

```solidity
interface IRewardManager {
  event RewardAddressChanged(
    address indexed sender,
    address indexed oldRewardAddress,
    address indexed newRewardAddress
  );
  event FeeRecipientsAllowed(address indexed sender);
  event RewardsDisabled(address indexed sender);

  function setRewardAddress(address addr) external;
  function allowFeeRecipients() external;
  function disableRewards() external;
  function currentRewardAddress() external view returns (address rewardAddress);
  function areFeeRecipientsAllowed() external view returns (bool isAllowed);
}
```

The Reward Manager precompile uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface) to restrict access to its functionality.

## Best Practices

1. **Reward Management**:
   - Choose reward mechanism based on network goals
   - Consider using a multi-sig or DAO as reward address
   - Monitor fee collection and distribution
   - Keep documentation of fee policy changes

2. **Security Considerations**:
   - Use multi-sig for admin addresses
   - Test reward changes on testnet first
   - Monitor events for unauthorized changes
   - Have a plan for reward parameter adjustments

## Implementation

You can find the Reward Manager implementation in the [subnet-evm repository](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/contracts/rewardmanager/contract.go).
