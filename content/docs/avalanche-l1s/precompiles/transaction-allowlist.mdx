title: Transaction AllowList
description: Control which addresses can submit transactions on your Lux L1 blockchain.
---

## Overview

The Transaction Allowlist enables you to control which addresses can submit transactions to your network. This is essential for:

- Creating fully permissioned networks
- Implementing KYC/AML requirements for users
- Controlling network access during testing or initial deployment

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Address** | `0x0200000000000000000000000000000000000002` |
| **ConfigKey** | `txAllowListConfig` |

## Configuration

You can activate this precompile in your genesis file:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "txAllowListConfig": {
      "blockTimestamp": 0,
      "adminAddresses": ["0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC"]
    }
  }
}
```

By enabling this feature, you can define which addresses are allowed to submit transactions and manage these permissions over time.

## Interface

The Transaction Allowlist implements the [AllowList interface](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface):

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

interface IAllowList {
  event RoleSet(uint256 indexed role, address indexed account, address indexed sender, uint256 oldRole);

  // Set [addr] to have the admin role over the precompile contract.
  function setAdmin(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to be enabled on the precompile contract.
  function setEnabled(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have the manager role over the precompile contract.
  function setManager(address addr) external;

  // Set [addr] to have no role for the precompile contract.
  function setNone(address addr) external;

  // Read the status of [addr].
  function readAllowList(address addr) external view returns (uint256 role);
}
```

## Permissions Management

The Transaction Allowlist uses the [AllowList interface](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface) to manage permissions. This provides a consistent way to:
- Assign and revoke transaction permissions
- Manage admin and manager roles
- Control who can submit transactions

For detailed information about the role-based permission system and available functions, see the [AllowList interface documentation](/docs/lux-l1s/precompiles/allowlist-interface).

## Best Practices

1. **Initial Setup**: Always configure at least one admin address in the genesis file to ensure you can manage permissions after deployment.

2. **Role Management**:
   - Use Admin roles sparingly and secure their private keys
   - Assign Manager roles to trusted entities who need to manage user access
   - Regularly audit the list of enabled addresses

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Keep private keys of admin addresses secure
   - Implement a multi-sig wallet as an admin for additional security
   - Maintain an off-chain record of role assignments

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor the `RoleSet` events to track permission changes
   - Regularly audit the enabled addresses list
   - Keep documentation of why each address was granted permissions

## Implementation

You can find the implementation in the [subnet-evm repository](https://github.com/luxfi/subnet-evm/blob/master/precompile/contracts/txallowlist/contract.go).
