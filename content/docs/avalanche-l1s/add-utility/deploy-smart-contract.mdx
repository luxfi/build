  EVM Version Warning - TEMPORARY

<Callout type="warn" title="Solidity Compiler EVM Version">
Lux LUExchange-Chain and Subnet-EVM currently support the **Cancun** EVM version and do not yet support newer hardforks like **Pectra**. Since Solidity v0.8.30 changed its default target to Pectra, you must explicitly configure your compiler to target `cancun`.

**In Remix:** Open the Solidity Compiler panel → expand Advanced Configurations → set EVM Version to **cancun**.

For **Hardhat** or **Foundry** configurations, see the [contract verification guide](/docs/primary-network/verify-contract/hardhat).
</Callout>

This tutorial assumes that:

- [an Lux L1 and EVM blockchain](/docs/tooling/lux-cli/create-deploy-lux-l1s/deploy-on-testnet-testnet) has been created
- Your Node is currently validating your target Lux L1
- Your wallet has a balance of the Lux L1 Native Token(Specified under _alloc_ in your [Genesis File](/docs/lux-l1s/evm-configuration/customize-lux-l1#genesis)).

Step 1: Setting up Core[​](#step-1-setting-up-core "Direct link to heading")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **EVM Lux L1 Settings**: [(EVM Core Tutorial)](/docs/tooling/lux-cli/create-deploy-lux-l1s/deploy-on-testnet-testnet#connect-with-core)[​](#evm-lux-l1-settings-evm-core-tutorial "Direct link to heading")

- **`Network Name`**: Custom Subnet-EVM
- **`New RPC URL`**: http://NodeIPAddress:9650/ext/bc/BlockchainID/rpc (Note: the port number should match your local setting which can be different from 9650.)
- **`ChainID`**: Subnet-EVM ChainID
- **`Symbol`**: Subnet-EVM Token Symbol
- **`Explorer`**: N/A

You should see a balance of your Lux L1's Native Token in Core.

Step 2: Connect Core and Deploy a Smart Contract[​](#step-2-connect-core-and-deploy-a-smart-contract "Direct link to heading")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Using Remix[​](#using-remix "Direct link to heading")

Open [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) -> Select Solidity.

![remix Lux L1 evm sc home](/images/smart-contract2.png)

Create the smart contracts that we want to compile and deploy using Remix file explorer

### Using GitHub[​](#using-github "Direct link to heading")

In Remix Home _Click_ the GitHub button.

![remix Lux L1 evm sc load panel](/images/smart-contract3.png)

Paste the [link to the Smart Contract](https://github.com/luxfi/lux-smart-contract-quickstart/blob/main/contracts/NFT.sol) into the popup and _Click_ import.

![remix Lux L1 evm sc import](/images/smart-contract4.png)

For this example, we will deploy an ERC721 contract from the [Lux Smart Contract Quickstart Repository](https://github.com/luxfi/lux-smart-contract-quickstart).

![remix Lux L1 evm sc file explorer](/images/smart-contract5.png)

Navigate to Deploy Tab -> Open the "ENVIRONMENT" drop-down and select Injected Web3 (make sure Core is loaded).

![remix Lux L1 evm sc web3](/images/smart-contract6.png)

Once we injected the web3-> Go back to the compiler, and compile the selected contract -> Navigate to Deploy Tab.

![remix Lux L1 evm sc compile](/images/smart-contract7.png)

Now, the smart contract is compiled, Core is injected, and we are ready to deploy our ERC721. Click "Deploy."

![remix Lux L1 evm sc deploy](/images/smart-contract8.png)

Confirm the transaction on the Core pop up.

![balance](/images/smart-contract9.png)

Our contract is successfully deployed!

![remix Lux L1 evm sc deployed](/images/smart-contract10.png)

Now, we can expand it by selecting it from the "Deployed Contracts" tab and test it out.

![remix Lux L1 evm sc end](/images/smart-contract11.png)

The contract ABI and Bytecode are available on the compiler tab.

If you had any difficulties following this tutorial or simply want to discuss Lux with us, you can join our community at [Discord](https://chat.avalabs.org/)!

You can use Subnet-EVM just like you use LUExchange-Chain and EVM tools. Only differences are `chainID` and RPC URL. For example you can deploy your contracts with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started) by changing `url` and `chainId` in the `hardhat.config.ts`.
