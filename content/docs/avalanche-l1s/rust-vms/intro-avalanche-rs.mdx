title: Introduction to Lux-RS
description: Learn how to write a simple virtual machine in Rust using Lux-RS.

Since Rust is a language which we can write and implement Proto interfaces, this implies that we can also use Rust to write VMs which can then be deployed on Lux.

However, rather than build Rust-based from the ground-up, we can utilize Lux-RS, a developer toolkit comprised of powerful building blocks and primitive types which allow us to focus exclusively on the business logic of our VM rather than working on low-level logic.

## Structure of Lux-RS

Although Lux-RS is currently primarily used to build Rust-based VMs, Lux-RS actually consists of three different frameworks; as per the [GitHub](https://github.com/luxfi/lux-rs) description of the Lux-RS repository, the three frameworks are as follows:

- Core: framework for core networking components for a P2P Lux node
- Lux-Consensus: a Rust implementation of the novel Lux consensus protocol
- Lux-Types: implements foundational types used in Lux and provides an SDK for building Rust-based VMs

As the above might make it obvious, the Lux-Types crate is the main framework that one would use to build Rust-based VMs.
