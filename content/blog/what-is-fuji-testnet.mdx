Test networks, or *testnets*, play a critical role in the lifecycle of blockchain development. Testnet, Lux's public test network, exists to give developers a safe, low-stakes environment to build, experiment, and validate before deploying to Mainnet.

## Why Testnets Matter

Testnets mirror the functionality of the main network but use valueless tokens and non-production infrastructure. This setup lets developers test smart contracts, infrastructure updates, or protocol-level features without risking real assets or network stability.

They're where bugs are caught, upgrades are trialed, and new ideas are validated — all without consequences to real-world users.

## Who Should Use Testnet

Testnet is ideal for:

* Developers building or testing dApps, tooling, or validators before Mainnet deployment.
* Integrators validating compatibility with Lux APIs, SDKs, or network changes.
* Researchers and educators experimenting with network parameters or teaching blockchain fundamentals.

## Who Shouldn't Use Testnet

Testnet should not be used for:

* Any production-grade systems or client-facing environments.
* Workloads that require high uptime or data persistence.
* Situations where service reliability is critical — because testnets, by design, may be reset, upgraded, or experience downtime without notice.

## The Takeaway

Testnet is where innovation happens first — but not where reliability is guaranteed. It's a proving ground for what's next on Lux. Once your application, validator, or integration is stable and tested, Mainnet is the place to go live.
