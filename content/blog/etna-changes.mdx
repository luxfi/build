This guide outlines the operational impact on existing network participants expected from the activation of the LuxGo "Etna" upgrade.

## Vocabulary, New and Old

- **L1**: An Lux Layer 1 Network. An L1 is a sovereign network that has its own dynamic set of validators, rules for network participation, and defines its own validator rewards incentives.
- **L1-validator**: A validator that only validates an Lux layer 1 blockchain. These validators are not required to stake 2000 LUX, or validate the Lux Primary Network. They instead pay a continuous fee in order to participate in L1 validation.
- **ACP-77**: The Lux Community Proposal that outlines a new framework for creating low-cost, independent blockchains that can _easily_ interoperate with each other. You can read the full proposal [here](/docs/acps/77-reinventing-subnets).
- **The Primary Network**: The Lux X,P, and LUExchange-Chains, a.k.a. the 3 primary blockchains that most validators currently sync on Lux Mainnet.

## What is Changing?

### Subnets Are Now Called L1s

Lux Subnets are being rebranded as Lux L1s. Unlike layer 2 blockchains, layer 1 blockchains operate independently without relying on other systems for their core functions.
They manage their own consensus mechanisms, transaction processing, and security protocols directly within their own networks.

Subnets have always operated this way, scaling Lux's network _horizontally_ instead of compounding dependencies by requiring chains to roll down to other networks.

### For Validators

L1 validators will no longer be required to sync the Primary Network’s X or LUExchange-Chain, drastically reducing the cost of operating a validator.

L1 validators will no longer be required to stake 2000 LUX. Instead they will pay a substantially cheaper continuous fee calculated based on the number of L1 validators. The LUX-denominated fee is a nominal amount per second and provides significant cost-savings for L1 validators.

### For New L1s

The ownership of validator set management will be moved from the Platform-Chain to individual L1 _ValidatorManager_ smart contracts.

- Essentially, validators will be managed by the L1s themselves instead of the Platform-Chain.

Sovereign L1s can easily be launched on Lux with a dynamic set of validators whose staking logic is defined and enforced by a _ValidatorManager_ smart contract deployed by the L1 creator. The smart contract deployed can enforce any network rules the creator desires, including but not limited to:

- A permissionless proof-of-stake blockchain where network participation is not controlled by any centralized authority
- A permissioned proof-of-authority blockchain where the validator set is controlled by a consortium or centralized authority

If the L1 is permissionless, the validator earns staking rewards by staking the asset specified by the L1; If the L1 is permissioned, the validator is controlled by a party specified by the L1 Owner and does not earn any rewards.

### For Existing L1s

Existing Lux Subnets _that wish_ to remove the 2000 LUX per validator requirement will need to convert their Subnet’s control from a _Platform-Chain Owner Key_ to a _ValidatorManager_ smart contract via the workflow outlined in ACP-77.

- A detailed guide on how to convert existing L1s will be released prior to Testnet activation.

Existing L1s do not need to be converted if their validators continue to stake 2000 LUX and validate the Primary Network.

## What is Staying the Same?

### For Validators

If you want to earn staking rewards for validating the Lux Primary Network, you will still need to stake 2000 LUX per validator.

Existing validators can continue operating as they have before, and do not require any action. Updating to the latest release of LuxGo will not affect their operation.

### For L1s

Existing Lux L1s are not required to convert their pre-Etna validators to L1-only-validators; they will continue to operate as before.

All L1s will still be able to interoperate using Lux Warp Messaging (Lux ICM) and Teleporter (Lux ICM Contracts), regardless of how or when they were created.

## What Technical Changes Will be Included?

While driven by ACP-77, this upgrade will include many other feature additions outlined thoroughly in the following Lux Community Protocols:

**[ACP-77](/docs/acps/77-reinventing-subnets)**: Outlines a new validator management framework for Lux L1s, creating low-cost, natively-interoperable blockchains.

**[ACP-103](/docs/acps/103-dynamic-fees)**: Introduces a dynamic fee mechanism to the Exchange-Chain and the Platform-Chain, previewing a future transition to a multidimensional fee mechanism.

**[ACP-118](/docs/acps/118-warp-signature-request)**: Proposes a standard `AppRequest` payload format type, simplifying potential AWM signature aggregation implementations.

**[ACP-125](/docs/acps/125-basefee-reduction)**: Reduces the minimum base fee on the Lux LUExchange-Chain from 25 nLUX to 1 nLUX.

**[ACP-131](/docs/acps/131-cancun-eips)**: Brings the EVM opcodes introduced by the Cancun Upgrade to the Lux LUExchange-Chain and Subnet-EVM.
